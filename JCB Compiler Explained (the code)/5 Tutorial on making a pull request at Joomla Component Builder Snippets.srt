1
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:03,584
I'm doing to Demonstrate to you

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,400
The process of now taking

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,728
You're committed changes to your forked version

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,288
But this one

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,104
Not the master branch

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:19,968
Now it's gonna be little different for you because of course I am a

7
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,528
Administrator of the master branch

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,112
So I'll see things that you maybe won't see

9
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
But

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:31,232
More or less you should be able to actually make a pull request

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
And

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,584
If you're not able to please let us know

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,608
So I can

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
Make sure that you're able to

15
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Do that

16
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
And

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,824
and there will be more guys involved in managing these Snippets

18
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:50,176
So it's not only myself that will be responding to issues

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
But

20
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,016
for the most part if there is really a holdup

21
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:56,064
I'll come in and help

22
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,856
Make sure that everything

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Works as we expect

24
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:03,744
So you should be able to after having

25
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
Done

26
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,096
What we've explained in the previous tutorial you know

27
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,936
Updating the snippets getting out a forked version

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Of the repository

29
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
cloning it down offline

30
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,848
And then basically it

31
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,688
Unzipping the package into that repository

32
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,784
Updating those files committing those changes with messages

33
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,184
And then pushing it up here after you have ensured that your branch is in sync with the upstream branch

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:34,720
Ok

35
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
That if you don't understood

36
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:40,096
Please go back watch that tutorial is the previous one with playlist

37
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
On YouTube

38
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
And then this one now

39
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
Will be

40
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,008
First steps

41
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Basically

42
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,592
off doing a pull request

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:55,200
So once you are in your repository on GitHub

44
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,224
And you

45
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:00,320
Push the changes up here you'll see this you know

46
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,344
Message

47
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,136
And be able to click on

48
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,160
Pull request

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:06,720
So

50
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:07,744
We've done that

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Next thing it will open a page

52
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Where

53
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,864
it Basically

54
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,400
Identifies

55
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,192
That you have forked

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
VDM

57
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:20,544
On the hyphen

58
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,872
IO for slash Joomla component Builder

59
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Snippets

60
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Master branch

61
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,296
As the base there's only one branch at the moment

62
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
And

63
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Then

64
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Your head

65
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Of the fork

66
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
But you've got is over here

67
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,536
And if it's says to you that it's able to do a merge

68
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Then

69
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,120
You're in good shape everything shouldn't

70
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,912
Be more complicated

71
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,752
You also now see that those commit messages you've made

72
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,568
Are now actually also showing up here

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,944
And exactly every change that was done so basically you see we changed it

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:02:59,968
From layout

75
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,504
To tables

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
And we did

77
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
shows you that we've renamed it from this

78
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:07,904
to that

79
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,976
So it actually identified that for us

80
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,816
And we can see ok nothing of the Snippets have changed

81
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
You can Scroll and see ok the snippet

82
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192
Isn't changed only those and the date

83
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:21,728
Which is good for we wanna

84
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:25,312
Be able to see that what When was the last change to the file

85
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,384
Here we can see that usage had

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
A new

87
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,200
Description added

88
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
So that means if I was to now actually click

89
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,088
On this link

90
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
Added according snippet

91
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Click there

92
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
You see ok that's exactly what he did added accorded snippet

93
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
And

94
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,400
The same goes for every one of these commit messages

95
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,472
And that's really what I meant when I said

96
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
Giving good commit messages

97
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,616
You make it so much easier for us to review the changes

98
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
And to make sure that it is correct

99
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:05,504
If it is very complicated and difficult

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,320
Usually this kind of pull request will take longer

101
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
So doing smaller amounts in snippet

102
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,952
Contributions of Stead of whole bulk I suppose

103
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
Would be

104
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,256
Better

105
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,143
Unless you already a trusted member in the community then I'll suppose it will go easier

106
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:28,799
So yeah if you haven't done any of these before maybe take smaller steps at first

107
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,871
Until we get to know you and until we more

108
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
Confident that you

109
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,735
Are a good contributor to do this project

110
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,575
Yeah so trust is important for us

111
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:45,695
So we'll be able to check this now no pull request has yet been made We've just come to the

112
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,743
Page of where it starts

113
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,583
You actually need to click on this create pull request

114
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
This will now open in area

115
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Which

116
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,751
You should give us information

117
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Of

118
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
What would sort of summarise

119
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:04,383
This pull request

120
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:09,503
So if it's like a new library let's say 3, 4, 5, snippets to a new library

121
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,807
Then just put that as the title

122
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,599
Whatever would be enough

123
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,391
To actually give those

124
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:20,255
That needs to review This is enough information to know what's happening

125
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,303
And what's coming in specially

126
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,583
If there is some

127
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:27,167
Specific detail now I know

128
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
That we will

129
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,495
In time at some

130
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,799
Documents to this repository

131
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,103
Which will give you sort of

132
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,895
Demo

133
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,735
Names and stuff in this field

134
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
So that you will know what to put in there

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
So that will still come so I from now just gonna say

136
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:50,207
Illustration of snippet contribution

137
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,559
Now I don't think you'll be able to make changes here

138
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
It's only the admin that actually has the ability to actually add a reviewer

139
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
And

140
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,543
Assign a label and

141
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,847
A project and a milestone

142
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:10,687
And so that will be the responsible of the of the admin

143
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
They might not do it

144
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:16,575
They might feel I will just merges in we don't need to make a much fuss of it

145
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,439
But if it's a big contribution and there need to be some real

146
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,207
you know

147
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,999
Work done here

148
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,559
We must probably make use of these tools

149
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
The description

150
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,167
We could either just use the

151
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
Commit messages as the description

152
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
Or like I said

153
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,823
That which we will maybe set up in the

154
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
In the future

155
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:45,503
We will now then create the pull request

156
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
And

157
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:51,903
Just given another glance and say ok everything is fine and click create pull request

158
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,559
When now the a pull request and really here

159
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,863
Is where we as the admin

160
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
Will now get involved

161
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,215
You cannot really take it further

162
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
And

163
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
Rightly so because we want to

164
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,871
Protect this repository

165
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,919
We wanna make sure only good

166
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
you know

167
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,271
Well-documented

168
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:20,319
Well explain well named

169
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,623
Snippets are contributed

170
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,207
And so once you have come to this point

171
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
You'll have to wait for one of our admin

172
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,583
To get back to you at actually

173
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,167
If they have issues they will start discussing it with you

174
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,447
Ask questions

175
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
And please

176
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
We wanna just

177
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,591
Protect you and protect everyone else

178
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:44,127
So don't

179
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,199
Be upset if they have questions

180
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
In fact be glad that they would

181
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,319
That will ensure that all of us

182
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
Will enjoy this infrastructure

183
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
So

184
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,999
Once everything is satisfied and everyone is happy

185
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:03,583
There will be some reviewers that will sign off

186
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,375
On this pull request

187
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:10,495
And I think at this stage if we have two reviewers sign off on it

188
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,287
At least

189
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,687
Then we can you know we can merge it into the master branch

190
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,295
Now there are different ways on how the merging into the master branch is done

191
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:28,671
This is mostly related and I'm doing this part mostly for the admin

192
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,487
Who may need to be able to do this

193
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
You could do it here on Github

194
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
Just click merge pull request

195
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,887
Since there is no conflicts

196
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:41,215
If there is conflict then it gets more complicated

197
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,567
And usually we will need more advanced admin

198
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:48,127
Guy who knows Git better

199
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
To maybe in a command line

200
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
Be able to resolve some of this

201
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,855
You can click on this link here and I'll show you the command line

202
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,415
Way of dealing with it

203
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
Or

204
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,463
You could select

205
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,791
One of these various emerging options

206
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:12,191
Now all of that I'll explain more in editorial that's just specifically directed

207
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,031
At the further steps that is necessary for admins

208
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,591
we're as regarding

209
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
You as a contributor

210
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,431
This is really where you end

211
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,455
And

212
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,503
We take over

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Now

214
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
Wanna tell you that

215
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:32,415
Once the contribution is accepted and it's merged in

216
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,743
Then it will again become visible

217
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,023
In JCB

218
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
In the snippet Git area

219
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,679
Which we demonstrated when we started out giving an overview of how things work

220
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,311
And really that's what it's about it's really all of this complexity that we've now discussed

221
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,335
Is

222
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,127
Not the main focus

223
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,663
The Focus is to

224
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,199
Enable us

225
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
to

226
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Enlarge the snippet

227
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,295
Area

228
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Without

229
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,135
Really intruding

230
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:08,767
Bond constant updates and database tricks to you know share these Snippets

231
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,327
But instead have this easy way of

232
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,887
Maintaining a GitHub repository

233
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Which in

234
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:19,775
Effect will then be accessible via the JCB git area

235
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,079
When you can add new Snippets

236
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,383
You can obviously delete snippets

237
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,431
Just going to the Snippets area

238
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:30,527
You can come in there and click here and trash a snippet

239
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
And

240
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
Then go to

241
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,623
Trashed

242
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
And here

243
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:40,511
Completely delete the snippet from your repository

244
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Which will then

245
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Cause the snippet

246
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
to

247
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
Be seen as non existent in your surface area

248
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
And so there are ways to remove duplicates

249
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,383
And I don't wanna go into a very long explanation again

250
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,687
On how to get Snippets area works

251
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
But

252
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,039
Our expectation is that some of you would feel

253
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:05,087
you know yeah I wanna contribute

254
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,927
Share Snippets with the rest of the community and in the same time

255
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,463
Get your name

256
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:14,047
Out there since looking at the files changed

257
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
You see that this news snippet

258
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:16,863
Has

259
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:21,983
Yeah it looks like it just did what it's been doing you now because my name is on most of these

260
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,287
What is because I added them

261
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
And that's why I my name is on there

262
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:27,871
And so

263
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,943
You are now also able to

264
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
Add your name in here because you are adding Snippets

265
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,807
And that's really the idea

266
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Well

267
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
So we come to the end of this tutorial

268
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,927
Thank you for watching

269
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:44,255
And I'm looking forward to seeing all of you getting involved

270
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
In this area as well
