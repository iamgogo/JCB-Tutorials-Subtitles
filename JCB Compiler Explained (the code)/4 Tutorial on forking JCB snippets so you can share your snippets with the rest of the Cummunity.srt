1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,608
Now that we've given you a general overview of how are things work

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:06,656
in the new snippet manager

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,704
I would like to

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,008
Take You The Next Step and that is

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,824
Showing you how to take shared snippets

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
And

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
Basically

8
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,176
Share them

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,992
There are two things that should be done

10
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,272
What is

11
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
You need to fork

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,088
The

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,648
JCB community Snippets

14
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:30,208
On get up so you need a github account

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,024
The second thing

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
Is once you

17
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
Done that

18
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:40,192
You would export the Snippets here that you would like to contribute

19
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,008
And you will add it

20
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
To this

21
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:49,152
Repository that you forked and cloned down to your developing environment

22
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,272
And you would make commit messages on every change that you are

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
Intending to make

24
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,976
The second thing you would do Although there are few steps in each of these

25
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,072
Things the second thing is that you would then

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,376
Make a pull request

27
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
So this tutorial I'm just gonna focus on the first

28
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
Few things you need to do

29
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,080
And that is just to get you

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
Basically ready

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,528
All the things you need to do until the very point when you are now ready to actually do a pull request

32
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
Ok so now

33
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:33,440
There are three things that I suspect we can do one is to improve

34
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
Already existing snippet

35
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
And then contribute that to the community

36
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:43,168
The second thing is to move and existing snippet

37
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
To a new type this isn't something I hope will happen often but it can't happen

38
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,200
That a snippet is in a specific type that is not the best suit for it

39
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,480
And

40
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
You might wanna suggest us changing that

41
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
So that would be a second thing

42
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,624
And the third one

43
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,720
Would be to actually add a whole new snippet completely

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,816
So I think I'm just gonna demonstrate all three of those

45
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,144
And then we'll see how that all plays Out

46
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:18,240
Until the very point where we are now ready to make a pull request

47
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,312
Ok first things first

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:22,592
We need

49
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Repository

50
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:26,432
And we need to understand git

51
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,224
Now if you do not know get

52
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,784
The story is not gonna cover that

53
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
You need to do your homework

54
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
And study upon git

55
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,744
When you do an export of a package for example if I were to click here on these

56
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,048
three herein

57
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
Clickshare Snippets

58
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:49,472
You see that it ends up showing you a bunch of links here and one of them is quick start for git

59
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
On Yodomy

60
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
At this link here I just searched on Google found it I didn't actually watch it myself I hope it's not bad

61
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
If you got a better one

62
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
Please share it

63
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,832
On on the issue somewhere and will will improve this link

64
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:09,696
I'm your even if you've got your own and you would like us to promote your

65
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
Tutorials on get sure

66
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Why not

67
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
We will support those who support

68
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,096
our community

69
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Very gladly

70
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Reality is

71
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
You need to get some

72
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,008
Your head around some of the git basics

73
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
So that you can actually do

74
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
A

75
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,104
Fork of the

76
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,664
JCB Snippets on github

77
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
And then make a pull request

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:32,992
So this

79
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Video here is the one I'm busy making so it will end up that being that link how to fork

80
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,208
JCB Snippets and get all this done

81
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:45,024
And then after that I'll be making this video

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
So we'll get to that in a moment

83
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,096
Ok

84
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:48,864
Now

85
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
You need a an account on GitHub

86
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
And so I'm just gonna use my own account

87
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:55,520
And

88
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
Simply go and

89
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,128
Fork the repository and use that as the demonstration

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,504
So needless to say I've got an account I've gone through all those hoops

91
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:09,088
And now I'm simply go to fork  this repository

92
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
To get to this repository

93
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:13,184
It's this your all up here

94
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,488
Another way to get here

95
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,512
Is

96
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,583
You go to get Snippets

97
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:25,983
And then the moment it's finish loading there is a link that you can click which will take you

98
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,359
To the GitHub repository and it's this link over here so we could click that

99
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,687
And as you see we're end up at the same place

100
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,455
it be good

101
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,503
So you could either just

102
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,087
Follow this URL appear all good just use that link

103
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
But you wanna get to Joomla component builder snippets

104
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,975
And I suppose

105
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,303
Since everybody that wants to contribute will need to fork it

106
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,143
I suspect this numbers here will change

107
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,287
And of course well this respositry is like 6 days old I haven't even finished the ReadMe

108
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
So there will be a lot of changes to this

109
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Repository and it will improve

110
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:11,551
So the first thing you do is click on this button here and forked repository

111
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
This will then ask you to select

112
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:18,207
Where you want to fork it if you belong to organisations whatever but then

113
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,023
Obviously by then I don't need to explain to you how it works

114
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:27,423
But if for some reason you don't then you select your personal or whatever organisation

115
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,727
You want a fork to appear in

116
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
And then it will basically

117
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
copy this repository

118
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
For you

119
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,967
Ok so now it's busy doing that I'm basically just copying it into my personal

120
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Account

121
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
Now

122
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Good practice

123
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
Every time you wanna make it change

124
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,415
Then

125
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,719
You need to follow a few steps

126
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
In

127
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
Having this repository in sync

128
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,095
With the

129
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,447
What we call upstream repository this VDM dot IO

130
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
Joomla component Builders snippets

131
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
This is what we call the upstream

132
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,895
All the master branch or whatever you wanna call it this is the main

133
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:15,551
Branch the one that is being used inside of JCB yours is indirectly being used

134
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:19,647
So whatever changes you make here would not necessarily affect us at all

135
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
But you obviously want them

136
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
Commit your changes to your branch

137
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
And then

138
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,839
Make a pull request

139
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:30,911
To the upstream branch

140
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,983
Where you would like to share this with the community

141
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:35,007
So that's

142
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,591
Sort of a quick explanation we'll do this slowly

143
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
I'm not gonna do the pool request

144
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Now in this tutorial

145
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,575
But I'll take you all the way up to the wall and then we will get the ladder out and finish that in the next tutorial

146
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,487
Ok so once you've done this forking of the main

147
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Repository

148
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,583
You need to clone this repository down

149
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
to your own developing environment

150
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:02,911
And

151
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
So that is what I'll do next

152
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,287
You would click on this

153
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Clone and

154
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,663
Depending on how you've got get set up on your developing environment

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,247
Again those tutorials you need to do before coming here

156
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,879
You would select either SSH or https  I would suggest using https

157
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,207
as this is of course more secure

158
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
But ok

159
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,815
So we'll just copy that and then we go

160
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
To I'm just gonna use my

161
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
My

162
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,983
New users home folder for now

163
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
So here I am in the command line

164
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
I'm running Linux so if you're running using Windows

165
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,063
You need to watch tutorials on how to do get in Windows

166
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,903
You might end up using a tool instead of command line

167
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,487
But if you did that you also be having had watched

168
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,559
Tutorials to help you sort of understand what I'm doing

169
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Ok

170
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:08,447
So first thing first we gonna clone it let's get that done

171
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
So I've cloned it

172
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,311
And we now have a folder

173
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,871
Call Joomla component Builders snippets

174
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
So I'm gonna change into that folder now

175
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,575
Just CD and a folder name and there we go I'm in the folder

176
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,183
And if I do LSLA  will basically see all the files

177
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,023
That was on get up now in that folder

178
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Now we want to change these files

179
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,423
But we not going to change them directly

180
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,263
We're going to use JCB to do the dirty work for us

181
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,639
Because we might have issues with escaping and all kinds of things that can go wrong

182
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
So just to have good convention

183
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,831
Whatever changes wanna make even if you wanna add files or new libraries whatever

184
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,903
You do it in JCB and you do the export package

185
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,767
And you should check that if you export a snippet

186
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
That it has three

187
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:08,351
Values always set

188
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
And that does three values

189
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:16,543
Well will obviously scrutinise it when you make her pull request

190
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,615
But that does name conventions

191
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,639
be standard

192
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:26,015
It's quite important as you can see this but got the library name you like it

193
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,367
And it's uppercase U and space lowercase V2

194
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
And then common with uppercase

195
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
And that is the type of snippet

196
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,279
And then it's the name

197
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,071
And obviously Jason file

198
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
So

199
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,375
This is the convention

200
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,959
And at this stage JCB built that for you

201
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
And I'm gonna show you where it gets this convention

202
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:52,383
Because to follow this Convention is what's really gonna be very important

203
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
If you making a new Snippets

204
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,527
For the UI kit version two library

205
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,087
You need to ensure that your

206
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:06,207
Version 2 naming in your system is the same as it is here

207
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:11,583
And if you are adding a new library that isn't already in our repository

208
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,399
Then you need to make sure that you use

209
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:17,215
The naming as found wall

210
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:20,543
As others will understand it as most common

211
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
The most common name in convention

212
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:28,223
And obviously if you need help on that you can open an issue and ask one of the admin

213
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
Do you know

214
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
Maybe give you a suggestion of what

215
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
To call the library

216
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:33,855
But

217
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,415
The Long and the short end of it is

218
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
Please stick to the naming conventions

219
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:42,047
Don't change this UI kit

220
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
To maybe the remove the space here or something that

221
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,679
Because it will end up

222
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,727
Just miss matching things and

223
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
One of word that from happening

224
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,383
Ok so first thing with done with forked repository and with now cloned it

225
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
Do offline developing environment

226
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,807
And now I'm going to go to JCB

227
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:08,671
I'm gonna export does 3 Snippets the one is a new snippet

228
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:12,255
The second is a changed or improved snippet

229
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:17,119
And in the 3rd is when you actually move a snippet to a different type

230
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:19,423
the one I'm going to target here

231
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
Is let me see

232
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,263
Think it's

233
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,079
Not showing here now

234
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,359
I hear this

235
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Food table

236
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,943
The food table snippet

237
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
Is at the moment in layout

238
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
I think there is a better

239
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:38,623
Type for this snippet and I know the snippet isn't

240
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
At this stage maybe the best

241
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,303
We could add some more food table Snippets but I'll leave that to some with you to do

242
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,887
The point is I'm gonna move this one

243
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
To the tables because it is a table right

244
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,055
So that'll be the one change I'm gonna make then I'm gonna add one snippet

245
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
To the UI kit versions 3

246
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
Since those tickets are still coming I'll just add 1 as they mistration and then I'll make a little change

247
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:10,367
To one of these Snippets just for them mistration ok great let me do that

248
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,975
Ok first thing a food table click on that one

249
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,023
Change it from layout

250
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
To tables

251
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,447
I'm gonna make any other changes I'm just changing the type

252
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,799
And this brings us to those three values that must always be set

253
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:35,199
And shouldn't change unless it's really seriously necessary the one is the name

254
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,831
You wouldn't wanna change this name unless you are 100% sure it should be changed

255
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,415
Because in effect it will create a new snippet

256
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:50,303
Because the way the Snippets work it builds the filename

257
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,583
With name

258
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:53,631
The library and the type

259
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,983
Those three components together makes up the file name

260
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:02,079
To changing any of those will in effect greater New snippet

261
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,383
And create a duplicate

262
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,711
And that's really wanna would try to avoid that

263
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
And I realised

264
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,343
This is gonna what I'm doing here now is inevitably gonna cause that

265
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,487
And I think it will show you why it's not a good thing to do it

266
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,583
But so I'm doing this more really for the demonstration

267
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,983
And so the ideal reality is that when we add snippet we added to the correct library and type

268
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,031
And give it the correct name

269
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:35,359
From the start and it we don't need to change those three again

270
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,151
If we do

271
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,967
Most of the time I would expect

272
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,527
That your pull request will be rejected

273
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:46,623
Because this will mess up many conventions and cause

274
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:49,183
Many duplicates across the system

275
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:54,303
In other developers environment where they would import this new snippet

276
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
And yet end up having to the same Snippets

277
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
Ok I've said enough about that

278
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,287
I hope you understand that important this part is

279
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
So let's go ahead save and close

280
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:08,639
The next one I'm gonna do

281
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:12,735
Is basically add a new snippet now since I've done this recording

282
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,295
Second time now

283
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,391
I've already done that and this is a accordion snippet  here

284
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,975
So you'll see that I've basically

285
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,279
Said that is a JavaScript snippet

286
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,583
It's an accordion

287
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,143
It's Yohaa kid Version 3

288
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
I look down these types

289
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,359
I'm wonder if some one of the other guys won't be better at this identifying of the types

290
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
So I might even

291
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
Not be the guy to make the call on this

292
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:47,295
I really am open to some

293
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
With better prospective

294
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,647
Maybe knows these libraries assorting

295
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,439
It is better

296
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
I think there's a place called

297
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
What is it

298
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,839
Collapse

299
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,375
Yeah collaps

300
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:05,727
It accordions could also fit other under this collapse I suppose

301
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
No let me do that

302
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,871
I know the first accordian we added for UI kit version 2

303
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,431
That is actually found on the JavaScript

304
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
But then we didn't have these many types

305
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,271
So

306
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,831
I'll just add it under this collaps  for now

307
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:25,951
Again I realise that this might be a difficult thing

308
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,719
And

309
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:31,327
What could help is going back to the actual  library itself

310
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
This

311
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,119
This is the

312
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:34,399
The link for it

313
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,703
And to try and see how they

314
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,775
Organised it and that's the problem

315
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
UI kit

316
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:41,823
Didn't

317
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,711
Give more breakdown besides calling it components

318
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,039
So it's only call the component it doesn't

319
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
Specifically added into a type

320
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:56,927
Whereas Bootstrap is doing a little better at that

321
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
So that's why

322
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:02,047
I'm not sure exactly where to place it now

323
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
bootsstrap

324
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,167
Actually adds it on the collapse

325
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
I think we won't go wrong to do the same

326
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,799
So save and close

327
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
There we go we got now

328
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,711
A very crazy risky change of a type

329
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:23,551
And a new snippet now let me take another

330
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:26,623
Snippet and just make a little improvement to it

331
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
I think I would use this

332
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
UI kit version 2

333
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,255
Form snippet

334
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,583
I'm just gonna add some usage information to it

335
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Ok there we go

336
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,191
And I'm gonna save it

337
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
save and close

338
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
So now I've made a change

339
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Basically two

340
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
This one

341
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:52,479
This one and that that one and So those are the only ones I'm actually going to share

342
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:56,831
This one when I created it it added my details

343
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
As the

344
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,159
Contributor

345
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:02,207
Which if you created a snippet

346
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,303
You know add your details you will notice when you create a new snippet

347
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:11,167
It takes a while before it's finish saving and it's because it's actually phoning

348
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Github

349
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,263
And trying to see if there isn't a snippet

350
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
Already with that

351
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,871
Relationship as explained in a previous tutorial

352
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:24,735
And that takes a while I'm I'm still wondering if that's the best idea

353
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,039
If we should continue doing that

354
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,575
I'm open for

355
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,111
Suggestions

356
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,927
But at this stage we just trying to confirm that

357
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,951
that snippet

358
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,511
Wasn't already created

359
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,303
And to avoid conflicts

360
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
Now

361
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:45,983
That means if it doesn't find it it adds your details which is set here in the option Global options

362
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
And as I explained in that tutorial

363
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,871
You can add your details and you would get some

364
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,943
exposure out there the community

365
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,735
With your details there

366
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,807
With these that I've just changed

367
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,879
The contributor will stay the same

368
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,951
But your name will come in on the blame

369
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,975
Layout

370
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,095
And your GitHub name will display there as recognition for your support

371
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,679
Ok so now and next thing share Snippets

372
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Well the reason I

373
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,823
Made it that it actually compiles is zip

374
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
File

375
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,895
Because it's easier to move around

376
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,015
We could argue that we might want to just have it zip

377
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
Move

378
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
Rather move the

379
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,927
Files right into your

380
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
A local cloned

381
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Folder

382
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,559
And so I am thinking at this stage maybe

383
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:45,631
We should add a switch here in the global options

384
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:51,775
That could make you choose it to do this or the other depending on what is most convenient for you

385
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,591
So I'm gonna go take the snippet

386
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,199
And then I'm gonna go and basically unzip it into

387
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
That

388
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
Repository that we've cloned

389
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,159
So here we are in that folder I'm gonna first unzip it right here

390
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,999
There there is those 3 files

391
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:15,071
That we want to make part of the repository

392
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
Now like I said I

393
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,703
Actually clone to repository right into my

394
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:21,983
user

395
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Folder

396
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,335
So let us go to that folder

397
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,383
Just go to cut it here

398
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Cut

399
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
And then paste

400
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,295
It right into that folder

401
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
Now we are updating

402
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,903
21 file

403
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,487
So it's asking you ready contains this file

404
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,863
Now so when you make an improvement on a file you will obviously have to replace it

405
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
So we click replace

406
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
Now that you've

407
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Added those two new files

408
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
And you have

409
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Replaced one of them

410
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,383
The third one

411
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
You see that we now have this

412
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Food table

413
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
The tables version

414
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:08,319
And we have it also

415
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:12,415
Add the layout version now one of them needs to go

416
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,951
We don't want duplicates

417
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,767
So you have to remove this one but

418
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:18,815
Don't remove it via the

419
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
The Interface

420
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
Use use git

421
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
To remove the file

422
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:25,983
So that you can also add a message

423
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,335
So that when you make your pull request and we see their files removed

424
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
It will know why you did it

425
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:35,199
And obviously then it will become a discussion

426
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:38,527
And this will demonstrate in the next tutorial

427
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
Ok so let's get back to command line

428
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
Yeah we are we can say git

429
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:51,071
Status to see what happened and we see wow ok what has been modified and these two has been added

430
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,423
The first thing we wanna do is remove the one that we don't want

431
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,799
Now because we have chosen to leave spaces within a file names

432
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
You need to

433
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:06,687
In put the file name in quotations

434
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,503
To ensure that it actually you know

435
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,063
Not misunderstand what you doing

436
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:17,184
So we will do a git  "rm" for remove

437
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
And then the file name

438
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
So

439
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:29,728
You could click tab after typing food table all about there and then lay out and it

440
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:32,032
Will basically grab the name for you

441
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
And then click enter

442
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,688
So it is removed it if we now to get status

443
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,248
Will see that it's in the deleted

444
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,552
Area and you need to actually

445
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Make a commit

446
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:47,392
to

447
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,696
Explain what you've done so it's get

448
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Commit "m"

449
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
And removed table-layout

450
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Since

451
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
I

452
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Moved

453
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Did

454
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Food table snippet

455
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
Tables

456
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
To the tables type

457
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
So

458
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,104
We're not at this stage exactly sure

459
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,920
How we are going to

460
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:13,504
What kind of conventions we gotta follow with these commit messages

461
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:20,160
There are reasons to have a few conventions here I just haven't had time to sort of get my head around it

462
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
so for now

463
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
we will keep it basic

464
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,560
But I'm sure as to community develops things will become more

465
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,632
Explained and so if you need help

466
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:33,472
Will most probably have some documentation up

467
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,752
At some stage

468
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,288
to get you

469
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,568
Do you know how to

470
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
Correctly do a commit message

471
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:44,736
I mean just what you should say first and what you shouldn't say and those kind of things

472
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,856
Ok so I've got a key that signs of every commit they make

473
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:54,720
You may not have that don't worry about it it's not really compulsory at this stage

474
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:58,560
It's just the way I can make sure that everybody knows

475
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
That it's me

476
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Ok

477
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:02,656
Now

478
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
The next thing here is we wanna

479
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
Add this new file so as we do git

480
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,800
Status

481
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,616
We'll see that now that file is been

482
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
Made part of the commit

483
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,200
At the branch

484
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,272
or the local files of this clone

485
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,344
And we wanna add those to other files

486
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,648
The first one I'm gonna Target

487
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,256
Is adding the food table which we just removed

488
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
So get

489
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,328
Status

490
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:32,608
Oops

491
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,312
Ok so now we've got that one added

492
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,360
And we need to give it a commit message

493
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,408
Now I understand

494
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
When we are doing such

495
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,808
Dangerous thing as moving a snippet to another type

496
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:56,672
I would expect us to actually make a commit message for every

497
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,464
Step of what we're doing

498
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:04,608
But if you're adding Like A Whole New Library and you got like 300 new Snippets that you contribute in

499
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,704
I wouldn't mind you adding all of that on the one commit message

500
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,520
Just making sure that the it was exported

501
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,336
via Joomla's component Builder

502
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,896
So that we don't have

503
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,992
You know the wrong kind of code within does snippet files

504
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,832
And obviously we will at the

505
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Pull request

506
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,976
Will scrutinize those files and we will have to look through them to insure

507
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
That it won't make any one system unstable

508
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,960
And so basically got a police some of this to do in sure that nothing gets you know

509
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,264
Merged into the master branch

510
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:47,616
That will put every anyone at risk as much as as far as we are able to

511
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
To prevent that we wanna do that

512
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,808
Well we working with snippet so it should be fine but just in case we wanna be careful

513
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,440
So when you making changes to one specific snippet

514
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
And you're not really like doing

515
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:05,024
Many at a time

516
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:09,120
I think be as detailed as you can in your commit messages

517
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,680
Because the more we know of What U doing

518
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,008
I think the easier it will be to merge it into

519
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:18,592
The branch and to basically approve your pull request

520
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,432
So the next commit message I'm just gonna say

521
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Git commit

522
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:29,344
Message update the food table layout food table Dot Jason to food table

523
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
Table

524
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,928
Food table Dot Jason since

525
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,232
It is more correct snippet type

526
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,536
Ok so that would then

527
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,608
Deal with that added file

528
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,912
Now we want to

529
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:46,752
At the accordion which is the the new snippet

530
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,128
So it's just get Ad and we can select the file name

531
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
There is a shortcut to this

532
00:25:54,688 --> 00:26:00,832
Is when you use the dot get dot ad that's usually when you have lots of files who just wanna add them all

533
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:05,440
It's like I explain if you doing in a whole bunch of snippets it's for a specific library

534
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,304
I would suggest doing library per library instead of just mixing them all up

535
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:14,144
Because if we target a library and just add a bunch of snippets for it

536
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:19,776
And then have a commit message just for that then we could explain that within the commit message

537
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,592
that it's for the specific library and so forth

538
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,640
Because usually with new libraries

539
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,456
You know it's good for us too

540
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,504
Sort of take it one step at a time

541
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:34,112
Ok now we've added that file now just going to add commit message for it

542
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
I'm just gonna say added to Accordion snippet

543
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:41,024
For you are cute Version 3 as demonstration

544
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,120
On how this should work

545
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,216
Ok and then just again

546
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,752
Sign-off that's

547
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Commit

548
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Get status

549
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:00,992
We'll see ok we've got one file left and we already 3 commits

550
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,016
Ahead

551
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
Of our

552
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Our

553
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
Branch that we have

554
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
Cloned

555
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,256
So just this last

556
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,536
file which is the

557
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
You know the update we made

558
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,376
So

559
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,680
We gonna first add the file

560
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,496
And then add a commit message

561
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,544
To explain what we did

562
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,944
Added the uses paragraph to explain how to use the Yohaa kid version 2 layout form

563
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:36,064
Yeah I think just writing out file name like that is

564
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Clear enough

565
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,392
And enter

566
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
again to sign off on that

567
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:43,488
Again if you don't have

568
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,536
Keys to then

569
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,888
It's good go Google this Start signing your request

570
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,472
But at this stage it's not a requirement as I said

571
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,288
Ok if we do get status now

572
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
Will see that we are 4 commits ahead

573
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:03,200
Now this is here where

574
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:05,760
We wanna do a few more things

575
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
To your

576
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:09,600
Commit all sorry to you all

577
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,648
Your 

578
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,672
Forked

579
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,976
And therefore cloned repository

580
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:18,048
Is what we wanna do something that will keep

581
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:19,072
Your

582
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:24,960
Repository in sync with the upstream

583
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,032
So I'm just gonna go and Google this quickly

584
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
This is a very helpful document

585
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:36,480
We first need to do this configure a remote that points to an upstream repository

586
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,528
So let's first look at that one

587
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
So this gives you

588
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:44,160
Little explanation

589
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Of you know what you should do

590
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:47,744
So

591
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,792
First you basically

592
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,608
List the current

593
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
Remote branches

594
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
That you have

595
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:59,520
So I've done that and it shows us that I've got this git

596
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,080
What the origin

597
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,872
And it's the fetched and they pushed

598
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,432
Remote branches

599
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
Now

600
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,624
It's gonna I say specify a new remote upstream repository that will be synced with this fork

601
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:20,512
So we'll use the original owner and the original repository

602
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
Name

603
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,888
Which In our case is the following

604
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,192
The original owner is this

605
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
VDM

606
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,008
Dot IO and

607
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,824
The repositories this one

608
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,616
so to get that name

609
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
You could come here

610
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
And

611
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
Yeah think you could get

612
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,576
This name here

613
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
There we go

614
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,392
That part

615
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
copy

616
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,536
So going back to our little tutotial

617
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
We will not type the

618
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:00,960
Get and I suppose you'll have to get the https version

619
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,288
Since you will not have permission to

620
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,592
Work with the SSH version

621
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,152
So let's get the http one

622
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,736
Which basically means that you should click http here

623
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:15,296
And then grab that version to jusy copy it

624
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,320
And

625
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
Control

626
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,160
Shift we will paste it in

627
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,488
Into command line or some

628
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
Command lines even gives you this option to paste

629
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,328
With a mouse

630
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
Ok so now we got that there

631
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
And we press enter

632
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
So it's now

633
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
Typo

634
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Try again

635
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,360
I didn't add remote add

636
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
So it was looking for a file

637
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,736
Ok there we go now if we did that version

638
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
Will see now

639
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
It has this upstream there is well

640
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,904
Ok so that was just add to remote

641
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
All the upstream

642
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,256
Repository to the

643
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
Cloned

644
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
Version that you have here

645
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,424
Now let's go see how to keep it in sync

646
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,752
So here it says that you would open the terminal

647
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,568
And you would do get fetch upstream

648
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:11,872
And it will basically pull down

649
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
This

650
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:16,992
And make sure that there is a branch called upstream Master

651
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
When you Checkout Master

652
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,112
And switch the master branch

653
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,672
and do merge upstream Master

654
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,304
Which if while you were busy doing these slippets improvements and things

655
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,632
And there's been commits to the master branch

656
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,680
You wanna make sure

657
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
That you

658
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,544
Actually before pushing all this upstream

659
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
Before making a

660
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,408
you know a pull request that you first merge

661
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:48,224
The already Changes from the master branch

662
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,064
Into your branch and then make your commits on top of that

663
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:55,136
This will help to try and avoid

664
00:31:55,392 --> 00:32:01,536
You not having specific commits in your branch I know it gets a little bit complicated

665
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,304
 but

666
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
If you get stuck

667
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
We will most of the times be able to just help you

668
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,448
Figure this out again

669
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,032
But like I explained in the beginning

670
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
To know how to work with Git

671
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,128
Is really your responsibility

672
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:16,896
So that

673
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,480
You and you are wanting to communicate or sorry to

674
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,040
Share with the community Snippets

675
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:26,112
You know how to first make a pull

676
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,416
Request sorry emerge

677
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,232
Your upstream with your master branch

678
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,352
And ensure that you are up-to-date with that before making a push

679
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,912
 to your branch and

680
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
Yes I hope you understand anyway if you don't please Google it and do some homework to get you

681
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
Get

682
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,384
Knowledge or freshen up and ready

683
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:54,528
Now I know we didn't make any changes to the master branch during this tutorial

684
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
So

685
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,880
I can demonstrate the process of git

686
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,160
Fetch

687
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,720
Upstream

688
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
And it will do that

689
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:09,376
But since I know that we didn't actually make any changes

690
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
In the end of the day

691
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,960
We we will not be

692
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,752
Really seeing any

693
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,568
Great fireworks happening right now

694
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:22,432
And I suppose some of you will experience it a little different

695
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:25,248
Especially if there's been changes to the upstream

696
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,272
while you

697
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
 been working

698
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
So git

699
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,648
Checkout Master

700
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,976
It's usually the bronze at your own but just to make sure

701
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,024
You're ready on the master branch

702
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Then git

703
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,328
merge

704
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
I missed out to get there

705
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,216
Merge

706
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
Upstream Master

707
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,104
And it says like now it's already up to date

708
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,920
If it wasn't it will actually

709
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,992
Merge those two branches

710
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
With the changes you've made

711
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,064
Now

712
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,880
That's what you should do before you do the following

713
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,976
Git

714
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Push

715
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:11,840
Which will now take these changes you've made

716
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,656
And you wanna push them

717
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,448
To origin

718
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,592
Origin Master

719
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
Now

720
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
Everything you've done

721
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:30,016
All the commit you made all the commit messages the files you removed

722
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,320
All of that now gets pushed up

723
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,624
To your cloned version

724
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:35,904
On GitHub

725
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,976
So if we go to your version now on Githup

726
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,560
And we just refresh the page

727
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
He'll say

728
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,472
This branch is 4 commits a head of EDM IO Master

729
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,056
Which means you are now ready

730
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
To make a pull request

731
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,944
A pull request is what we will deal within the next tutorial

732
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:05,856
So everything we've done so far and this tutorial is to get the Snippets that you've changed the contribution

733
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:06,880
You wanna make

734
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
Into the branch that you forked

735
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,048
And to do it in a way that you're not completely out of sync

736
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,840
With a master branch

737
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,120
Which is living

738
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
