00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,096
I was recently reminded about a

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,400
Featuring JCB that I

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,240
Said I was going to elaborate on in an advanced course

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,544
A course which I haven't yet

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,360
Been able to make because of

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,920
Time constraints in my own schedule

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:24,064
But I will nonetheless give it to tutorial in explaining how this concept works

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,208
So that we can start collaborating and seeing how we might want to expand on this

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,256
Ok so

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,328
First just bring everybody on to speed

11
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,376
Let me , sorry play that

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,704
that snippe that I made about a year ago

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
That this also means if there is a form field you want to extend

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
That doesn't exist already in our advanced Seminar we'll show

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,464
You how to add your own form Fields here there's basically two places you will need to change I wish I could tell

16
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:07,328
Tell you now one of them would be to add the field and update it accordingly

17
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:13,728
And the other one would be too to add it in a few places in the code

18
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,568
And also in a Jason file called settings

19
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,968
So those are some of the things we will deal with in advance

20
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:30,368
Adaptation of component builder we will still set up that series very soon it's not finished yet though

21
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
So here is how it works

22
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:41,888
It's not that obvious some of the concepts I'll need to go slowly and make sure

23
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
That you all follow

24
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
But

25
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,544
There, this is

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,176
What are the things that you need to keep in mind is that if we expand on any of these field types

27
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:57,248
Were actually expanding the custom field

28
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,832
Let me show you that what that means in JCB

29
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,928
We going area in JCB called field types

30
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,768
Now, these field types are editable and extendable

31
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:15,680
But and you can create new ones but you can only create field types here that either do not

32
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
definitely those don't exist if you create a field type with the same name you are going to mess

33
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Things up

34
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:28,736
So here it's important that you only create field types that do not already exist

35
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
And that they are the field types that are available by Default in Joomla itself.

36
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,928
So

37
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
It must be

38
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
This list of field types

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
Now there might be more we not listed here

40
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
But it must be

41
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
Native to

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:46,912
Joomla

43
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
That is what this field type area is for.

44
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,592
But there is in this list one field type called custom

45
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,432
Which is like the chameleon of field types

46
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,016
It is the field type that can be any field type

47
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:06,624
And it's this field type that we are able to extend

48
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
It's options now currently if we go to create one of those

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,864
You see that it is already extending 3

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Field types

51
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
So at the moment

52
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288
It's extending list

53
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,824
Radio

54
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
And checkboxes

55
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,920
You see that with the extense

56
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,944
Attribute

57
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,344
And whichever you want you just add that value here in this upon this list that we can

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,112
expand

59
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,208
Now let me show you in the compiler how this works

60
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:47,072
So in the compiler we go to a file called C fields

61
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
The compiler obviously located

62
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
In the

63
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,824
In the helper

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Compiler here's the files, so we opened this one C fields now C fields has a Methode

65
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,296
called set custom field type file

66
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
This is the method that built the file as well as sets it's content

67
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:20,351
And so most of what you need to know happens right here you could follow some methods like this build dynamic

68
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:26,239
In NetBeans if you click on control

69
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,591
And hold over the method tells you in what

70
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:31,871
Folder

71
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,711
And file that method is first declared

72
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,551
And then also gives you some

73
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,623
perimeters is if it has them mapped out

74
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
So

75
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
We can then see that this field

76
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
Sorry this method is in the structure

77
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,351
If we search for it here

78
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,895
We see that it is basically starting with a Joomla version data

79
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,967
Now the Joomla version data

80
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Is being set

81
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
By another method so we can search for that

82
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Going up

83
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Which is it's

84
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:23,583
Space we say yeah it's being set by set Joomla version data

85
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,983
It's the method and that method starts by calling this settings Jason file

86
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
So

87
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,335
That's where it gets the data

88
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:40,735
Which we need to build the file no that's already done everything about that is in place

89
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
But where the limitation is, is that if we go to this file, this file

90
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,695
is found in the

91
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,999
Like I showed in the editorial

92
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Component builder compiler Joomla 3, you scroll down and you double click on the settings

93
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,423
Jason

94
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
That's where this file is

95
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:01,983
Now

96
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:07,103
If we want to expand on one of those field types let's say we want to

97
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,663
Create a different type of list field

98
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
We could copy this

99
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,271
Slip it and just paste them again

100
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:18,367
And then change the the name of the file me

101
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,439
And let's also then at that me here

102
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:28,095
And also add it here so basically this will become the new name

103
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
Of the

104
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:32,703
The file if we goning to use it in the

105
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
JCB interface and that means

106
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
Let me just save this

107
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
If I copy this

108
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,687
And I go to JCB

109
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:45,247
Then I'll put that in there like that

110
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,319
Now it will be pulling that data

111
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
It"ll use that new file but new file doesn't exist so to make sure it's there we go up

112
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
And

113
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:00,351
We take this file we copy it and

114
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,375
Pasted in

115
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
Now we just rename it

116
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,959
to

117
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
Me like that

118
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
And now we have the file

119
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,359
This is how it looks

120
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:16,223
The thing to note here the moment is that

121
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,551
It's still really the same as the original

122
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:24,927
So this you'll only do if you want to break away from original implementation

123
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:29,279
The original implantation updates this value

124
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
It updates this value, it updates this value, this value, it adds this information and it adds this information

125
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,983
So

126
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,567
That would be the place holders

127
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,127
Which can still be targeted

128
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
Except this one

129
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:53,343
If you want to override the get input value, sorry get input method

130
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,951
Then this you need to remove this placeholder

131
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:03,071
And you need to add your script in here

132
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,167
I'm I'm looking at the option to expand

133
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,215
JCB's custom field

134
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
So that that specific

135
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,639
Area becomes a little bit more dynamic

136
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
So

137
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,575
At the moment it isn't like that but we we were talking about that and see if we could do that

138
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:30,207
But you could see whether we have done that eventually by this coming to this method

139
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,535
In the C Fields file

140
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,839
And then scrolling down

141
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
If you come to the bottom of the method

142
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,495
You'll see that you start running up to these Place holders

143
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:46,079
Which are being placed in the file content dynamic

144
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
You know

145
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
array

146
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
And

147
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:57,087
There you would notice we've got this get options PHP

148
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:03,743
J form get options PHP and that maps to this one right J form get options PHP

149
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:08,095
So literally this information here

150
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
Is being built

151
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Down here

152
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:13,983
And

153
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:17,823
This is the value we adding how How did we get this

154
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:23,455
PHP code value we go up a little in the file we'll see that

155
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,015
There is actually a

156
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
value here

157
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
This is just me

158
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
checking out stuff which check if there is a PHP value and then we load those values in

159
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:42,655
Into here now where does this value come from well it is in the custom field

160
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
It is this area here

161
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
So that means you have a placeholder which at the moment is says

162
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,711
Says to Target the get options area

163
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,271
But you don't need to

164
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
Target the get options area right I mean it's only because that place holder is inside the get option

165
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:07,231
Area you could do this

166
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:13,375
Sorry I it was wrong button

167
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
You could do that

168
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
Remove all of it

169
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
And save and now

170
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,151
In this

171
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
Area in Joomla you can now put

172
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
Let me show you

173
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
You can put the whole

174
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:38,463
Public function get options method with your own code

175
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,511
Right there

176
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
No problems

177
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,959
And you can now write your own get input method right here and it

178
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Will dynamically

179
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
Be added

180
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
to

181
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
To this place holder here

182
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
So this placeholder can currently be used

183
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Anywhere you like

184
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,295
And in your new field type

185
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,367
But you could leave it the way it was

186
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,047
And just code in your whatever changes you want to make by removing the add button

187
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,839
You could do the

188
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,143
The get input

189
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,703
So here is the get input method now

190
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:23,775
So you can add that and you can

191
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,407
Change that to whatever you like this is the default that we usually build for the button

192
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,711
But you can do anything

193
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
Here now

194
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,271
And

195
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,927
Then that is what this field would be that's why I will be different because you doing your own implementation

196
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
of the get input

197
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:47,839
You can go to this J form field list method

198
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
Right you

199
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:52,191
You can actually go look at its methods

200
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,335
It is under your libraries, Joomla at the moment it's on the form and fields

201
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,687
And your scroll down to list there is J form list

202
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:07,807
And you can look at how it is doing the implementation

203
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
And you can

204
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:13,439
Add options, you can change that you can

205
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
You can extend this and you can even go back and again check the J form field

206
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:26,239
And you know have extend that once options

207
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:29,567
Reality is you could take any

208
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
Of these fields

209
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,895
And copy it

210
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:38,015
So let's say we want to expand on the Note 1 we can say copy

211
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
We can take it back up here

212
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,487
And pasted in here

213
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:54,143
Now we need to rename it so we can always get to it easily and the way I've done that

214
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,983
as I've said ok it should be J form

215
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,287
Field

216
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,847
And this would be note

217
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Simple

218
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
J field note

219
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Ok

220
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,735
So now we have it here

221
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,015
J form

222
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
Field note

223
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
And we can now just

224
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:17,695
Update some of the areas in it

225
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,767
To ensure that it becomes dynamic

226
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
With the same

227
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,679
Let's see so we'll use this value

228
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
First of all

229
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
We'll have to grab everything from there today right

230
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
And copy that

231
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
And we have to

232
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Do this

233
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
go over like there

234
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,319
Yeah

235
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:50,207
And I like to change that a bit

236
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
Make it look like that

237
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:02,751
Ok the rest we could leave then again this we need to change

238
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,847
So the best to make sure it will work

239
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
If you just grab

240
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:08,895
That

241
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:13,247
Well that's grab this whole little thing here like that

242
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
So now we are going to extend

243
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
The

244
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Form field

245
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
But like a note

246
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,791
So

247
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
We are also going to change that value

248
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:36,031
Because it needs to be Dynamic it needs to use the new field type that you going to create in the customer

249
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:42,175
Field and that's where you have to put that now this is the area you want to now adapt

250
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,503
The input is going to stay like that

251
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,575
So since this is the area want to adapt

252
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:53,695
This is the place you want to also have Dynamic I would say

253
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,743
Take take this value

254
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,791
I know in the beginning

255
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:04,191
While JCB still evolving this might not work for ever but

256
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,311
For the time being this will work quite well

257
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,943
You you just basically changing where this place holder gets placed

258
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
We wanted to make sure that

259
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:27,231
To have a different get input value structure we could still do that and now were this one we

260
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:32,351
We have a different way that is going to build the label and

261
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:37,727
We can l call it note so let's do this

262
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:43,615
We go to our settings by Jason we copy again that previous one

263
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,919
And we pasted in

264
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
And now this we called note

265
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,599
And so we do this

266
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,671
and that one

267
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:03,327
Note the capitalisation must match the doing these but not here because this one

268
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
Remember this value

269
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,167
Is built, let me save this

270
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:08,703
Is Built

271
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Here

272
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Up

273
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
It's built over here so the first part is field

274
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:21,503
And then the second part is what comes from JCB in the extends attribute

275
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,343
So that's why I just keep it lower case make it simple

276
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,951
So in our Jason setting it's going to be basically this value

277
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,535
So in JCB to Target this new field type

278
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
We'll basically have to add

279
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
That

280
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
extend Note

281
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:39,935
Now

282
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:45,823
Here you need to realise that you are now no longer targeting the get options

283
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,871
Although it says that

284
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,455
We Are Moving the get options value with the note

285
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:53,759
We are moving it to the get label

286
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:59,135
So you know how to hit the right code there that's going to be used in the get label

287
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,791
Now If you forgot how that should look like then again scroll down to where you took the file

288
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,583
from originaly

289
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
So we open note

290
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,311
And here you can at least see how they started while they started with element

291
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
And if it doesn't exist return empty and then and so you can decide to change

292
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
This style

293
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:28,831
How it behaves the get label

294
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,903
And it's your own type of note

295
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:32,927
So

296
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,207
This

297
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
Extending option I realise get options should actually be changed

298
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,167
So that it could be more movable

299
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,519
That is possibly what we will do and if I do that

300
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
I want to do it like three, four times I will do it once and have everyone's things break

301
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319
and everybody change over and then it's done sorry about that but I can't see another way at the

302
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:05,695
The moment is called get options but it is a dynamic value which really

303
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
Links to this

304
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,535
Whatever you put in this box

305
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
So

306
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:15,167
This is what it ends up in that place holder

307
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
And so

308
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
We could change this to PHP for the

309
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
Placeholder

310
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
Called and it will give the placeholder a name

311
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
get options is to specific we could change that and then

312
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
in fact I think I will put the new if I change it I'll put the placeholder name right here so that

313
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:42,047
In the in the file

314
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
You could easily just rename this

315
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,143
To the corresponding

316
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:50,751
Yeah I think that's what we'll do anyway

317
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
This is still

318
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,943
Really a movable concept we now literally extended

319
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:04,063
Note and we created our own new input for our list

320
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,207
Wish you could do whatever you like here but you only at the moment have one placeholder

321
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
For your Dynamic values so there has been a request to have two at least two placefolders

322
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,935
two Dynamic coding

323
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,239
Placeholders

324
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,335
So we will end up having one for here and one for somewhere else

325
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,407
So I'm still

326
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,247
Working on make basically adding another one of these

327
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:38,111
Text areas to the custom field area

328
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
So that is what we are looking at

329
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,719
And

330
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:44,255
At the end of the day

331
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:50,655
It's really just to give you freedom to do expand on the custom field

332
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:55,007
It's a custom field we talking about it's not another field type

333
00:19:55,263 --> 00:20:01,407
It is the field type called custom field and yes and many of the values now like button

334
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:09,343
You know some of these values become obsolete somehow because

335
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,159
For example the button value

336
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
In the compiler

337
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,279
If we go back to that compiler method

338
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,607
Will see that if we go down here

339
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:27,775
It says add button that's the place holder remember in the original

340
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:30,079
File we had let's say

341
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,383
Go up here again

342
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:41,599
Original list file had a placeholder called ADD button

343
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
It is that place holder which were looking at here

344
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,719
Add button

345
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:50,559
So this is dynamic hash is a value

346
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:53,631
And we have a method called set

347
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:55,679
Add button to list field

348
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
So if that method is right here so we don't have to search for it is easily find and it's basically

349
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Checking

350
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
Should we add as is ADD button true

351
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:11,295
And if it is it builds that code

352
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
For the

353
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Get input

354
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:18,976
And it writes a whole lot of

355
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Code here

356
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:27,936
So if you are going to remove the add button placeholder

357
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
It will no longer

358
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:31,008
Update it

359
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
And

360
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,104
You now need to set your own get input

361
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Method then

362
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,200
So

363
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,528
That is what the add button placeholder does

364
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:44,064
It adds this

365
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Value in

366
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,624
If it's required

367
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,440
So

368
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,560
Now going back to our new fields

369
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,608
here

370
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
You will

371
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,192
And your

372
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,752
Custom code

373
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:10,688
And you will now know that this field type is targeted with list me so

374
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,248
Again in JCP just for good measure

375
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,296
This will be list me

376
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:19,392
I think I should run one or two just to make sure

377
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:25,536
That everything works because to be honest I haven't actually done any of this

378
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Before

379
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
I'm in expanding it's just that

380
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
Quickly quickly checking ok at note is in place that one is in place

381
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
All is been saved

382
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,808
I'm just going just to demonstrate adding extending a note so I'm going to say noted

383
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
And the name gonna pull called it nothing

384
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,168
OK

385
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,032
Great stuff

386
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:15,456
And we are going to

387
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Remove

388
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Most of this

389
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:23,648
Because it's irrelevant

390
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,512
I'm gonna change to note

391
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,864
obviously no button available No table

392
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
no Component no View

393
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,264
Just while we could just leave the prime

394
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,568
That

395
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
Make sense

396
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,200
And I just copied the default note

397
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
Code

398
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,528
And maybe

399
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,856
We can just add something here

400
00:23:57,696 --> 00:24:02,560
It says if close is true now we don't have a value here for close

401
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
So that means

402
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:07,936
we now need to go to custom

403
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:13,056
And just expanded to have the close element or

404
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,848
we could just say

405
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,384
That is going to be

406
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
we just gonna leave that out

407
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,856
And then the heading

408
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,304
Just to we can see we made it

409
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
And then

410
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:38,656
Give it a name

411
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,760
It doesn't know

412
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,040
That this is

413
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,112
A non database value but ok

414
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,672
So now we have a new field

415
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,256
Which expands note

416
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,352
And let's add it to something to see it in action

417
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,936
Go to demo component

418
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
Admin View

419
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:17,056
Let's go to the admin View

420
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,848
wrong place

421
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Cancel

422
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
we should click here

423
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,320
no that was the right place

424
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,184
And fields

425
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Added

426
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:37,536
OK

427
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,656
Just add a field here

428
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,264
Expanding note

429
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:51,616
And we make that also full width and me make it

430
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
two

431
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,688
and that should

432
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Do

433
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
Close

434
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
Compile

435
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Demo

436
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,888
Ok I've had forgot that error here and it's something about the class not being there

437
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:18,752
let me just Check that out and go to the code

438
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
Now we go to demo

439
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,968
We see that it created the field noted

440
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,296
And we have here a

441
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,112
Problem ,let see

442
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:39,232
That's one of the drawbacks of

443
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,024
Basically the

444
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,096
Current implementation we have here

445
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
In an our

446
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,752
If we go back to our component

447
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:52,032
Admin View

448
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,104
Basically back to that field

449
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:00,224
We have values here

450
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:02,784
Which are double quotes

451
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
And the problem is JCB

452
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,696
Can't handle double quotes in this area

453
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,512
It can only handle single quotes

454
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,328
That's one of the current limitations

455
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
So

456
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:21,472
Knowing that it can only handle single quotes

457
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,824
Makes it harder to do do coding here

458
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:31,712
But we could in the future maybe look at a work around

459
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,832
So for now I'm just gonna take this out just to show you that it works

460
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,696
And when you code you just keep in mind that you can't use

461
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Double quotes that one

462
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
You can't use that one

463
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:49,120
You can only use single quotes in this area at the moment

464
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
Ok

465
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,264
Now it's going to ask me for class

466
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,544
Here

467
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,104
Take that out as well

468
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,128
Just for now

469
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,176
And save

470
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:06,528
Now let's just compile it again and install

471
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
Go back here refresh

472
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
And there's Home Run

473
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,888
Nothing great stuff

474
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
So our

475
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,960
Little

476
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,544
Expansion on the Note field has worked

477
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,920
And very much similar is how I will be for any of the others

478
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:39,552
Except now obviously for this identified limitation

479
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
Ok so let's summarise what we've done

480
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,792
If we want to add the class here

481
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
If you want to add

482
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,680
More values than what we have here now is heading

483
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,728
Title description

484
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,264
If you want to

485
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,128
Add more of that here we need to expand

486
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
This custom field type

487
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:10,016
So we need to come here and

488
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,808
With the

489
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,392
Like your next two buttons maybe you wanna add another

490
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,696
Value that you wanna have available

491
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
You will have to do it here

492
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,560
And it will then be available

493
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,680
For any custom field and you'll obviously if you selected and it's not

494
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:33,056
Related to either the radio the checkbox or the list any two just remove it out

495
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Ok so

496
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,712
Yeah that's

497
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,992
At the moment

498
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:46,624
This area seems to still require little bit more thinking

499
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,816
You can of course ignore the hole

500
00:29:55,328 --> 00:30:01,472
Having put it here to get the information here yeah you could skip that

501
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,568
And just say the scripture is going to be this and

502
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,616
Titles going to be there

503
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:11,968
Ok you can hardcode it in there

504
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:16,576
It's basically just JCB Joomla are taking XML

505
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:20,416
Values and translating it

506
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
And will that's one of the reasons why

507
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:24,256
Your

508
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,024
Double

509
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:30,144
Quotes doesn't work here is because we're

510
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,936
Saving this in a

511
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
In a way that

512
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,568
Should be XML safe but ok that's

513
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
An whole another topic

514
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,688
Have fun

515
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,504
This this is really how you expand

516
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,552
The custom field area

517
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:49,600
By adding new custom

518
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,464
Field types or field options is that maybe

519
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
To make it more

520
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,816
Differentiation between this

521
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
You could do that

522
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,704
Just a little heads up if you do that

523
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:11,104
And you've done a good job at doing that you must consider sharing that

524
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,152
Changes with the rest of us

525
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:18,016
Because of one issue which it the moment there isn't it work around

526
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,552
And that is that

527
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,368
If you update your JCB install

528
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,928
This

529
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,072
These new values that you've added here will actually be overwritten

530
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:38,496
It will be taken away and you need to add them in again and if you

531
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:43,872
You decide to push these new like maybe you doing a

532
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
Form field note expand and

533
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:49,248
Then you might

534
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:54,112
You need to also include this new field in the file the actual

535
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,208
File that is in component builders

536
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,256
This area here

537
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
So this

538
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
This actual file

539
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:07,424
These two files would need to be part of your pull request

540
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,264
I am also going to

541
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,824
Within the next week I'm planning

542
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:16,896
To sort of expand on this area

543
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,016
So if you really wanna do something big just give it

544
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:27,392
Another week or so and then come and look at the code look at

545
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,792
In the future if you watch this tutorial come and look at what happened in this area

546
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:38,144
And then check check these placeholders

547
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,192
You know take take them

548
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:44,288
Go back to the area which which I showed you in the C field

549
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,896
And

550
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:52,480
Check out this set custom field type file

551
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:56,576
Check what's happening here this These Place holders

552
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,392
Are available in your PHP

553
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:01,952
So that means

554
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
The table value the component value all of those values are available in this PHP

555
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Area

556
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:12,960
And those values are usually what you set up here

557
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
So

558
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:21,408
It's sort of a little Dynamic Place holders so while we are loading the

559
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
Code

560
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:25,504
We are also

561
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,832
At the very end here

562
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,416
we are  taking the the place holders that we setup here

563
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,208
And we are

564
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,232
Updating

565
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,792
Older placeholders in the code

566
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,096
And this code eventually

567
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,424
Then gets placed into the

568
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:48,800
This get options PHP like a explain before

569
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:55,200
Now you might come here and see what I've changed some of those and what I'm going to do

570
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:00,832
and what My aim is going to be is to make this area easily more scalable

571
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,416
And more Dynamic so that

572
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,440
You could

573
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,232
Be even more

574
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:10,816
Free to create custom Fields that are

575
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:14,656
Yeah you need to do your application

576
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
Ok

577
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:22,080
Well thanks for watching I hope this even expands your understanding of the custom field

578
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
Implementation even more
