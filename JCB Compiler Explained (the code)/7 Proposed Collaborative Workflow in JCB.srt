1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,912
I wanna talk to you about a collaborative workflow now JCB

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,216
Like any other Joomla component

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,824
Can function in a shared environmental quite easily

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,176
Will you have one website or one system that is online

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,224
And people can login

6
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:21,760
And they can

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,808
Edit documents

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
Say that's a components

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
and they can

10
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
Click on a component

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,232
And while they're working on that component

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,304
No one else can

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,352
Because it will in effect

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,448
Lock the component out to them so if we open

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,032
That list you again you see that it's checked out

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,592
And so this functionality

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,152
Is available in JCB already

18
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:54,784
So with it whether it's an admin view whether it's field

19
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:00,416
If your login and someone else opens it up it takes out the item and so people can work together

20
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
Quite easily

21
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
In a shared inviroment

22
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,024
Weather have one JCB

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
But multiple users

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
More than that

25
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,424
It's also has a very strong

26
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
Permissional structure

27
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,288
Which if you open the component Builder

28
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:21,408
permissional area you'll see that it has quite a long list

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,200
I suppose longer than

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
One might anticipate

31
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:27,552
But it's huge

32
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
List of permissions

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:35,232
And that means you can have different groups in your Joomla

34
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
You know groups in regarding to these

35
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,400
But I have access and is allowed to work on only certain areas

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,936
And

37
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,984
So your possibilities

38
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,312
Of setting up a development workflow with JCB

39
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,384
In one Joomla website is endless

40
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,736
And that was the whole idea behind here was to make JCB

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
A place where you could have teams work together

42
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
In Joomla

43
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,624
Developing components

44
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,160
So this is the

45
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,000
The one that's worked from day one this or this this approach

46
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,072
And it is it is very powerful and

47
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
I've already been told by quite a number of developers that they are using that they put teams working together

48
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
On components and it is excellent

49
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
So I'm happy to see that working

50
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:27,712
But like we all know JCB's most

51
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:31,552
desirable environment is an offline environment

52
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:36,928
Where you do development in your own local developing environment

53
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,256
Where you maybe have a virtual machine running

54
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,072
And you can do docer appointments

55
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,888
Or something like that when your on Joomla and

56
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:48,448
You're safe within your own network

57
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
And when you do that

58
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,336
The collaborative concept of working together other developers

59
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
Sort of doesn't come to its right

60
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,688
And

61
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
That's what I've been working on

62
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:06,368
And the whole idea of the JCB packages was birthed out of this

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,136
Need

64
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,744
The need to collaborate with others around a specific component

65
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,144
So we've also started working on a area called servers

66
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
In which we now have actually

67
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Added

68
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
This option

69
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,128
For SFTP which is

70
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,664
Oh really smart

71
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
So you know protocol

72
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,808
And it's purely PHP so it it will function

73
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
In

74
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:37,856
Moving

75
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,440
At the moment only moving zip files and things around

76
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
But the idea would be in the long run

77
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,120
That we could possibly create connections between different JCBs

78
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,520
Which could automatically synchronise things like almost like they're on the same

79
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
Yeah system

80
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,360
But ok

81
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:02,176
 I did have a thread open on that

82
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
On GITHUB

83
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,320
Connecting JCBs with each other to sync development on agreed

84
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,088
Projects

85
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,928
That was The issue that I opened up issue 233

86
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:13,952
And

87
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:17,024
Then there was basically discussion between me

88
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
And one of my coworkers

89
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
And then

90
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,655
Some other in the community

91
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Which ended up in

92
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,775
Saying good this is a premium feature

93
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:33,919
And although we have sort of put it on the back burner

94
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Like you see me say here

95
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,783
I am still very much thinking about

96
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,367
Taking this and making this reality

97
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
and so part of doing that

98
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:47,487
Is taking a specific area of JCB

99
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:51,071
And that area is the import of JCB packages

100
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:55,935
And to improve this area so considerably that we basically

101
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:01,823
The synchronisation will be nothing else but a JCB package traveling from one to the other

102
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,919
And updating each other automatically and so

103
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,015
To achieve that I started working on a feature

104
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:14,879
Which now is available in the latest version 2.7 9

105
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,671
Auto

106
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
Wait where's it

107
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,255
Development method right that's the one

108
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:25,119
And what we called it is the default is the way that it always worked

109
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,447
And then there's this expansion there's a tutorial about this

110
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,007
Which really explains that you can select

111
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Specific

112
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,055
Components

113
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,335
That you've developed

114
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,615
And then

115
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,151
On the

116
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Frequency of this

117
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,735
Cron job

118
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,063
It will actually build and install

119
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
This project automatically

120
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,695
So that that is the first step of needing to

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:54,559
Sort of make that connection between two projects possible

122
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,911
Now projects literally talking out different Joomla websites right

123
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,495
One being offline one being online and then

124
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,567
This one that's online to serve like a hub

125
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
And I'm everybody that's offline

126
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
Would be pushing the changes to this online and pulling Again from it so that is the 

127
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Long-term aim

128
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
So if you are listening

129
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:24,255
That you would realise where I'm heading I'm I'm trying to get to the point where I can have a team of developers

130
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
All having their offline environments

131
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:30,143
Doing development on the same project

132
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:36,543
And as they feel they have achieved a certain level of stability in the project in a certain area

133
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
They can make

134
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,615
Literally a pull request

135
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,199
To the on line environment where JCB is running

136
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,295
And then others can review those changes and

137
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,135
May that component can come in as a clone

138
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:55,743
And they can play around with it until they feel yeah this this is good enough

139
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:59,583
And then it can be merged into the main branch somehow

140
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,447
So it's somehow putting GIT in a in a sort of an interface

141
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,239
And

142
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Then obviously at some point I became

143
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
So overwhelmed with the task

144
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:15,455
That I started doing all these other little things that you now see coming about

145
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,991
One of them being

146
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,647
That I added a BBM package area which basically takes all the packages that we have

147
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
Available online and put it right here easy to

148
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
So get hold of it

149
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,303
And

150
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,399
So there are some free ones between them at the moment like this demo package here

151
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,215
All of the packages that

152
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,519
Are actually available won't GITHUB

153
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:43,871
The actual Joomla component of this package

154
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,431
Will have the source code link

155
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
Showing up so that you can actually go look if you

156
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,575
If you let say use select

157
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Which one question and answers

158
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,951
Then there's actually a source code

159
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:00,511
Area we can go look on get up

160
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:06,911
To this program and you can actually take it and install it on Joomla website to see it's functionality

161
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:08,703
And to see it's features

162
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
And if you then

163
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
Yeah that's how you can evaluate the package easily

164
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,479
Basically it means that this JCB package produces this source code that's really what it gets down to

165
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
So now today

166
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
The

167
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
The current workflow

168
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
Model

169
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,463
Looks as follow

170
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:34,047
First you need to realise there is the JCB mapped

171
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,583
Two-piece there

172
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,935
Mapped pack component and then there is the Joomla component

173
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
This is the one that is sort of the feels the views the code everything inside

174
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
JCB

175
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
That can be moved

176
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
between

177
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
JCBs

178
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:51,967
Being

179
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:52,991
One

180
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
On one website one on the other

181
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
So you can actually extract a package

182
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,463
And give it to someone and you can import it into his JCB

183
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
And this is what this

184
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:04,767
Is

185
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,863
Where is the Joomla component is the produced package which

186
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:15,263
Then when you compile that map to component it produces a Joomla component and these are two

187
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Different things

188
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Although they are the same thing

189
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Now

190
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
When I think about the workflow then

191
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,503
This is affecting this

192
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
But this cannot

193
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:27,807
Effect

194
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:28,575
This

195
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
So you can

196
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:35,487
Change here make changes to this package and it produces a different

197
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
Result

198
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
In this package

199
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:44,447
But if you make changes to this package it does not immediately would make any difference to this 

200
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
Package unless you make

201
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,031
Use of what we have

202
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,847
Called the custom code implementation

203
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
We do editing

204
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Within the IDE

205
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:58,783
Then yes then making changes to this package will affect this one

206
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,575
But that's a whole different story

207
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,343
And

208
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,879
Little bit

209
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
Beyond what I want to explain here

210
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,327
So when I think about a work flow then I would like to see that we make it change to this package

211
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,447
It gets validated by what we have here

212
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
And then everybody

213
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:22,591
Updates again this package to be the same as what we decided on

214
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,151
Here now that may not make sense

215
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
So let me add some arrows

216
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
And demonstration to this

217
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,855
I'm gonna use this question and answers

218
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Package as an example

219
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
So if you were going to become

220
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
A

221
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,839
Collaborator on the question answers package

222
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,911
Then you first need to go to the source code of it

223
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:50,495
So on GitHub you would go and open the source code

224
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
And you will work

225
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
This source code

226
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,151
Which would then

227
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:01,503
Give you the option of making changes to this

228
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,551
But not directly

229
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,575
Manually

230
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:07,135
But instead through JCB

231
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:08,927
Now

232
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,535
That means that you will then clone this repository that you're forked

233
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
Down to your local development environment

234
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:18,399
And doing it as follow

235
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,703
The first thing you then do

236
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:25,311
Is you go back to your component where it's installed on your local developing environment

237
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,871
And you open the options area

238
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,663
So that you can set the

239
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Folder path

240
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,967
For your GIT

241
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Files

242
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,039
You gonna have a place

243
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:39,903
Where all you GIT files basically the component on ZIPPED

244
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
Is going to be placed automatically for you

245
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:43,999
So

246
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,023
here you would

247
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
add that

248
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,863
So I'm gonna place it in my

249
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,167
Basically my

250
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,447
User folder

251
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,799
I'm going create a folder there called Joomla I have to do this manually

252
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,895
And then inside of that I'm gonna add another folder called Git

253
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:05,247
So that's what I'm gonna do and I'm gonna save this

254
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,319
And then I'm quickly gonna create this folders and

255
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
So I'll show it to you in the command line

256
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:17,791
Ok I need to first add the

257
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
Company information here

258
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
Can now save and close

259
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,703
Call another one too

260
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Choose

261
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,311
This is just the language make sure

262
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
To put it to British at this stage that is

263
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
The

264
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Best practice

265
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,247
And oh yes another thing

266
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:40,575
I don't want to have any prefix at this stage

267
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
And yes

268
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Save and close

269
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:48,255
Ok now we've got our GIT path setup

270
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,327
Now I need to actually create this files

271
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,887
In my local developing environment

272
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,447
So I'll do that via

273
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,471
Command line

274
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
So first I will

275
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,055
Make

276
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,847
Directory

277
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
Then I'm gonna change to that directory

278
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:09,759
Now

279
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,063
In that directory I'm gonna create another

280
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Directory called GIT

281
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
And

282
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,743
Change that directory well

283
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,631
So this is the directory where in my components are going to be placed

284
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,983
Not the moment if we look inside of this directory there is really nothing showing

285
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
But

286
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
The first time I compile a component

287
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,895
And I say to the compiler to add my

288
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:39,967
Files to the git repository is going to create

289
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,759
A folder with all the

290
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
So code inside it

291
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
Automatically

292
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,135
So you remember that I

293
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:48,159
Cloned

294
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,463
This repository on GitHub

295
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,279
Joomla questions and answers

296
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Now

297
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,863
If I do continue I need to get

298
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
The JCB package for this

299
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,007
Installed into my JCB

300
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Program

301
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,639
The way this is done obviously we we go to the JCB package area

302
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
And we select

303
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
The

304
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,015
Questions and answers package

305
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,551
And we

306
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,831
Get the package

307
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,391
Then we add the key

308
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,439
And we

309
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
At the moment there is not really any components

310
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,839
On this in install so it's fine to leave this to yes

311
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,447
I'm gonna also Force local update of anything

312
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,055
And so we can just check again that it is the right package yes it's to correct package

313
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,847
And the checksum

314
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
You can read this

315
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:47,807
Basically there is a checksum for the package and at the moment it seems that everything is fine you can make it final

316
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
check of just clicking this link

317
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,183
And make sure that this number is the same as the one seeing

318
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,719
On the page here

319
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
And yes it is

320
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,023
So always good

321
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
And then we click continue

322
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
And there you have it we've got the component in our

323
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
System

324
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,263
This component now

325
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
If I compile it for the first time

326
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,407
Let's again just this for

327
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
For your sake let me show you

328
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
That there still is

329
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
No

330
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
File here whatsoever

331
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Ok

332
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:21,599
Now

333
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,903
I'm going to compile this component

334
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
And I'm gonna say

335
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
Add to repository folder

336
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Ok so this

337
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,679
Should the component been moved to your local repository folder now we already set the path for this

338
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
So now you work

339
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
If we have

340
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,055
Say yes and then compile this

341
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,687
We see that it's actually been done and it's all well

342
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,735
And we now go back to that folder

343
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:55,391
And we check again we see that now there is a folder with its exact name

344
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,951
So if we changed into that folder

345
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,047
Will see that it is at the moment

346
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
LSLA

347
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,863
There's no GIT

348
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,167
Information here so this

349
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,495
Folder is basically just the source code without

350
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Any GIT

351
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
Connected

352
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
To it

353
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,871
So what we gonna do now

354
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,895
At this point

355
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,967
We are gonna connect your forked version

356
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,503
That you have on GitHub

357
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,575
To this folders here

358
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,367
And that from now on

359
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:28,671
If you make a change to the component

360
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:34,559
It will be and you have to push the changes in this folder to the GitHub repository

361
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
The way to make this the

362
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
GITHUB

363
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
Link the two to each other

364
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
Use the following commands

365
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,383
Making sure that you're in the correct directory com -

366
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
Questions and - and

367
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:54,015
- answers - - Joomla - 3

368
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,831
You can run the command r m

369
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,855
- f

370
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
R

371

Asterix

372
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,695
Now you know

373
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
You might say why

374
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
did we

375
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,839
Compile it in now delete everything

376
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,631
Well unfortunately

377
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,935
That is the only way to do this

378
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,055
Without difficulty you first need to get the information down from GITHUB

379
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,079
And

380
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:22,431
Then you might ask why didn't we just do that first and that was because

381
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,735
It seemed easier to just let

382
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
JCB build folder for you

383
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
And then

384
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,599
You use the folder

385
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:33,951
And so I'm gonna just wipe out all the files if we checked there now

386
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Basically no file left

387
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
Then we going to

388
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,303
Start by

389
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,351
Actually pulling

390
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
The

391
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,423
The files down from GITHUB

392
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,983
First is to say GIT in it

393
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,383
Then to actually add the remote branch

394
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:58,015
And to get the remote branches URL your type out get remote add origin

395
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:00,319
Then go to GitHub

396
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
Where you forked the branch

397
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,231
So and then here you get the URL is copying it here

398
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,351
You can either use the HTPS or the SSH which in my case is what I prefer

399
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,911
So you pasted in there and click

400
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
So to save it

401
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
If you now would check the the config information

402
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,615
You see that this remote branch is been added

403
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:27,711
Now the next thing to do is to pull down the master branch

404
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
This is done with GIT

405
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,295
Pull origin Master

406
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
This will now get all the information from GITHUB

407
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
Which basically is the same as what you have

408
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,559
Here behind my

409
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,375
Command line screen

410
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,935
So if we were now to gonna do 

411
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
LSLA

412
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
Will see that there

413
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
There is actually

414
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,431
The files all back as they should be but now we have GIT here as well

415
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
And my

416
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
My

417
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,111
Command line shows us that we have a git repository and we are on the master branch

418
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:07,647
Ok

419
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
So that was to get

420
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,767
us linked to this repository

421
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:18,655
Now we can go and compile it again at the moment if we do get status

422
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
It should say that everything is fine and clean

423
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:24,287
And there is no difference between these two

424
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,567
But

425
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
The moment we now

426
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,175
Do another compile

427
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:33,759
Is going to change the files obviously

428
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:41,183
So now if we do GIT

429
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:42,463
Status

430
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,791
We see that all these files were modified

431
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,447
And we can check to see what is it that was modified by doing git diff

432
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,031
And we'll see mostly ok it added

433
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
More lines

434
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,615
The compiled version

435
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
Was the

436
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,943
24th of April

437
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:06,271
And now it's the 5th of May

438
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:09,599
Ok scroll down

439
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Ok

440
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,743
So ok here is another one that changed

441
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,399
Ok so there's some XML that changed

442
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
Oh yes and we made a improvement

443
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
To the Jason to string in JCB

444
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,735
so it also updated those functions

445
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,807
And we removed the abbreviative

446
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
sorry , prefix

447
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,159
To the name so that's been updated

448
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:49,023
So you can look through the diff to see all the changes that has been made

449
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,303
The reason why

450
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,375
The XML file format is changed

451
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:57,983
Is because we are using different XML compiler here

452
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:01,823
And I can show you that in a moment

453
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,615
That you might understand

454
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
OK hold on

455
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,199
Here in the global options

456
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,551
There is two ways to compile the XML in JCB

457
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:17,952
It's really about While the reason why there are two ways it's because some servers don't support this one

458
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,256
This simple XML

459
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:21,024
Option

460
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,888
It doesn't support it and mostly because it doesn't have all the

461
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:27,680
PHP

462
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,496
Models of things applications

463
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,776
Activated

464
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:32,800
So

465
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,872
What we then have as a string manipulation option

466
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:40,992
Which basically doesn't use the simple XML but does actually

467
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,296
Still replace most of the time

468
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,368
Building all these XML field string by string

469
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
This one is How JCB started

470
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,488
And is most certainly

471
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,816
Working very well so I like using it

472
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
But

473
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,376
It's not necessarily

474
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,656
The best option

475
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
It's faster

476
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,008
So we compile it again now

477
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,080
We will most probably see less changes to the exit now

478
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,896
Because I remember that package actually did

479
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,664
Have

480
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:14,016
Did use the string manipulation option

481
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:16,576
to exit this

482
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
you just press q

483
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,392
And then again

484
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
How to go back in

485
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,256
And let's see what changed now dates

486
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,608
And yeah there's much less

487
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
I don't see in XML changes

488
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,424
Now

489
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Ok

490
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:34,752
So

491
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
Basically it's just a date

492
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
That is changed

493
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,384
And it's talking about the build date

494
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
Now this is something we might need to look at

495
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:47,808
Because the reason why is changed is because we imported it

496
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,136
Answer your your application thinks the build only started

497
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:51,904
Today

498
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
Wait I don't know

499
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:55,232
24th of April

500
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:01,376
Times flying that's all I realise that that is actually correct

501
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:02,144
Ok

502
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,936
So you we have

503
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,008
All the changes is really primarily

504
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
Just the built date

505
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,640
And there's a little bit here there which JCB itself has improved

506
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:13,920
So

507
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,992
It's improved with this variable here

508
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,808
Determines that that it's external

509
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:23,136
value that's with a Jason string remember I said to

510
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,184
you we done a little improvement there

511
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:29,792
So it really just actually reflecting the JCB improvements

512
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,608
Which is really the way it should be

513
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Ok

514
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
So that means

515
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,752
If you now we were going to make a pull request

516
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:43,616
I will most probably will say thank you because you basically just updating

517
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:47,968
The JCB improvements to the component

518
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Ok so let's show you how that will work

519
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,856
You would now make a commit

520
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,904
We should look something like this

521
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
and remember I always show you the the simple easy way to do it

522
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,048
There are more precise

523
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,328
Better maybe but

524
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
more difficult ways

525
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:15,616
So update a component with improvements made to JCB

526
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,712
And we click that obviously you sign

527
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,272
Your comment and

528
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
GIT

529
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Push

530
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
So this point

531
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,720
You have made a change to component via your JCB

532
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Install

533
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
And you're pushing it back

534
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,608
To your forked version

535
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,656
Of this components

536
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:41,728
Joomla component which is on GITHUB

537
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,520
Now that means

538
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:45,824
That if you refresh this page now

539
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:48,640
He'll say that it's won't commit a head

540
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
Now

541
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,344
I think at this point we need to discuss how many changes should you make before you make a pull

542
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Request

543
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,208
And if 5 or 6 or 7 people make the same changes

544
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,488
Regarding

545
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,816
Implementing to JCB's improvements

546
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,864
Who's do we accept 

547
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
Yeah all those kind of things

548
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,984
I suppose we'll still be ironed out as we go

549
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,824
But at this point you could click make PULL request

550
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,664
And it will automatically take

551
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,736
Take the

552
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:28,320
Components and show that it can be merged then you click

553
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,136
on that PULL request

554
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,208
And your comment should usually end up here in the

555
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,000
In the title area

556
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:41,888
We will for every package that we manage we'll eventually add a pull request template

557
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:43,168
With instructions

558
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,472
And how to manage it from here further

559
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:50,336
And at this point you're actually saying I've made changes to the JCB

560
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Program

561
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
Package

562
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,152
Whatever you wanna call it

563
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:57,760
And these are the changes I have made, tested and please let me know

564
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:58,784
If you

565
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,320
Like what I've done

566
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
and

567
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:06,976
There will be discussions here and please do not be discouraged if it doesn't go

568
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
You know quickly

569
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:13,376
There there obviously reasons for us to always go through things quite slowly and thoroughly

570
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
I know in our own

571
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,216
In-house developing team

572
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:20,800
Things are going quite fast at this point because we have

573
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,616
Sort of come to a place of understanding each other's

574
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
Perspective so it goes quickly

575
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
But

576
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,016
Working with strangers and people we don't know

577
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,832
Is obviously going to be more difficult and slower

578
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:39,232
 you won't have the option of editing all these values like I do because I actually own this 

579
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,000
repository

580
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:42,560
But you must probably will be able to

581
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,864
Come up to here and actually put in

582
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
The necessary information that will ask for

583
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
And then click here create pull request

584
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
So this point If I did that

585
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
It will

586
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,408
create a pull request and

587
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:01,760
The developers will be notified and will start communicating from here

588
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:06,112
Now when this pull request with your changes have been

589
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
Fully accepted

590
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,720
And obviously you haven't made further changes

591
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,256
To this component

592
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Then

593
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
The next part of the

594
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
Process needs to happen

595
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
So

596
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,216
If I can illustrate what has happened so far

597
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,264
Your first forked

598
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,872
The component then you imported that components JCB package

599
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
Then you made changes in this case we didn't make changes but you could have added a new field or a new View

600
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
Then you compiled

601
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
It

602
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,648
Then in your local development

603
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,208
You committed to changes to the GIT

604
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,744
repository so there's

605
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
The here is also

606
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Linked

607
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,144
And commit the changes to GIT

608
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
Then you put the changes to the forked

609
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
 version

610
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
And then you make a pull request

611
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,312
And now the next step

612
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:03,712
And this is the place where the JCB package manager is going to really come into play

613
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Because now

614
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:09,088
You want to contribute this changes not only

615
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
To the actual

616
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
Joomla component which already is well-being

617
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
You know this this

618
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Pull request

619
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,792
Is contributing it

620
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,840
To this area of the component

621
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,912
When this has been finalised

622
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,936
The Next Step

623
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,984
Is to also contribute it

624
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776
To the JCB map to component

625
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,336
And this one is

626
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
Crucial because then everybody who's

627
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Helping to develop

628
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
The map component

629
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Get this update

630
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:40,064
Via JCB package manager

631
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
And

632
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,672
Ok so we're going to now demonstrate the next step

633
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:50,560
Let say at this point your commit is been accepted and merged into the

634
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,584
Root

635
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,120
The master branch

636
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
Of the repository

637
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
Then it should look like this it will say merged

638
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,568
And if we were going to look at this here

639
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:05,152
It says now update the component with improvements made to JCB

640
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,176
Ok so

641
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Really

642
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
That was

643
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:13,088
The the point at which the next step must take place only once

644
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,672
The changes you've made has been accepted

645
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,952
In the 

646
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
Joomla component

647
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,024
Source

648
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,560
Of the project

649
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:27,168
Now The Next Step is to do that with JCB the package as well

650
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:31,776
All VDM's JCB packages are kept

651
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,592
in the JCB packages repository

652
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,200
So the next thing you need to do is you need to fork this repository

653
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
I already forked this repository

654
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
Few weeks ago

655
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,344
Few days ago

656
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
But you'll see that

657
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,464
It's already four commits behind the master branch

658
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
I can't really do anything

659
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
Until I get in sync again

660
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
With this master branch

661
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:59,168
Making a commits now

662
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,216
will mess things up and so

663
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,312
First thing I'm going to do is make sure that this repository

664
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
Is In sync

665
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
With the master branch

666
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,296
So obviously this repository needs to be cloned down to my local system

667
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:22,208
those of you that have quite a number of repositories and keeping them all in sync is a pain

668
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,536
We have this little shell script update forks

669
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:27,840
Which is very useful

670
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,424
Even if you're gonna run the Shell script itself

671
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
you can at least sort of

672
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
Peak at some of the commands

673
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
And how to get this done

674
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:43,968
The way this does the moment what it does is it runs you know gets all the repositories that you

675
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:47,296
You have forked and then it also updates them

676
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,088
So there are a number of

677
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,184
SSH file that you should have a look at

678
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,232
I'm just going to open this

679
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:56,768
Update repositories

680
00:30:57,792 --> 00:30:59,584
Well now I got the file open here

681
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,400
I realise ok this is not gonna work

682
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,472
Unless you able to understand

683
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,240
Bash

684
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:09,056
You must probably not gonna actually

685
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,336
Be able follow this

686
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,408
So Let me rather do the commands one of the time

687
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
Inside of that Repo

688
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:19,552
But at least you know that there is a package here

689
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
And if you do know

690
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,880
Git  Sorry I mean bash

691
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,952
Then this is most certainly something to try out

692
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:29,536
I'm it's working very well I'm using it quite a lot

693
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:33,632
And it's keeping all my forked repositories up to date and then sync

694
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,448
With the master branch so that if I work with them

695
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
That it already is ready and I'm able to just you know

696
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
Jump in and do it

697
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:45,152
But it's not that hard to do it manually anyway

698
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,200
So let's do that

699
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:52,320
If you haven't cloned down the repository to your local developing environment

700
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:57,952
Then you need to do that first nothing of what I'm gonna show you now will work unless you've done that

701
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:03,840
there are a few documentations that GITHUB has that helps with us quite a lot so if your on windows

702
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,888
or Mac or Linux

703
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:13,568
Yeah you can actually go to this URL,s or just type in Google update my fork repo

704
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,104
And do a search

705
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,664
And then look for the one

706
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
Which sort of

707
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:21,504
Well this is a place you wanna end up at

708
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:24,832
and then I gonna tell you that you must first configure

709
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,928
Your repo to actually see the remote upstream

710
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,488
So click on that and do this first

711
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,816
And then we'll come back to this one

712
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,912
First we do is we gonna just check out

713
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,984
In a repo what is the remote branches

714
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,360
And so we see that it only has this

715
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
To remote branches

716
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
And it's fetched and pulled from those

717
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,296
Now we want to add the remote branch

718
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
Which is the upstream branch

719
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:58,368
And we gonna use

720
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
This one and

721
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:03,232
Add the original owner so this one is your name

722
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:06,048
This one must be the original owners name

723
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:10,144
And the original repositories name So those two

724
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,680
Values you need to

725
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:12,960
You know update

726
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,056
The way to get them is go back to your Repo

727
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
And just

728
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,872
Click on this

729
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Value here

730
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:23,456
This should take you to

731
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
To that

732
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,016
Original branch

733
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,064
And then you can just get it

734
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
By coping

735
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,624
This value here

736
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
So then your type remote

737
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,232
Add upstream

738
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,536
Like it says there on GITHUB

739
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
And you will

740
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,608
Control shift

741
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
v

742
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,424
To paste in command line

743
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
Or as if you you can also paste

744
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,008
With the mouse

745
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,080
And so there is the repository

746
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:52,128
I have a little

747
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,016
Change to my SSH which means I use VDM

748
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
To identify the server name

749
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
That is something you must have you wouldn't need to do

750
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,440
And you click enter

751
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
Ok so now

752
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,512
If we do that

753
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
Remote branch will now see that there are two

754
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
Remote branches

755
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,192
Sorry Two branches

756
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
That are remote

757
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
And one is the origin and one is the upstream

758
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
And that now is

759
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:24,128
Time for The Next Step

760
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,432
Which is the sync the fork

761
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:28,224
So first what we will do

762
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,528
we will fetch the upstream

763
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,928
This will basically fetch the files

764
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,208
That has changed

765
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
From the upstream

766
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,792
Which at this stage we know

767
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,816
Is the

768
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
Main Master branch

769
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,960
Then just to make sure that you are on the master branch

770
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,496
We are going to

771
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:57,920
Say

772
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Git

773
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
Checkout

774
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
Master

775
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:06,112
To make sure you are on the master branch next

776
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
We are going to

777
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
Merge

778
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:13,536
The upstream branch into your master branch

779
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,168
This will look differently depending on what happened

780
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
But

781
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:23,264
It will give you a bunch of information and then

782
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,848
This branch is now basically

783
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,896
The local branch is now in sync

784
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
With master branch

785
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,992
Upstream Master branch now

786
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,016
To get this

787
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
To also update your

788
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,648
Branch on GitHub you just need to do get

789
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:40,672
Push

790
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:45,024
And this will push the changes

791
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Back to GIT

792
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:49,376
Now there are many things that can actually

793
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
Go wrong or

794
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Sort of work out different

795
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
In in Git

796
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,312
And so I'm not here to teach you how to use git

797
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
Made you run into

798
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,664
Some Grey areas or difficult issues

799
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
You need to Google and

800
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
Figure out how to get this done

801
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
This is just

802
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
Illustrating

803
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
The

804
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,392
Proposed workflow

805
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:16,000
Of developing components in JCB while collaborating

806
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
With the greater community

807
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
Around a JCB package

808
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,424
those of you that watched

809
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,752
The tutorial on how to contribute

810
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
To the community

811
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
Directory

812
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,104
JCB packages

813
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:34,176
The match of what I'm gonna be explaining further

814
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,736
Is already covered in that previous tutorial

815
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
And

816
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,088
So we are almost finished with the circle

817
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,696
We started by forking the JCB sorry did Joomla component

818
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,000
And importing the JCB package

819
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,048
Then making changes to that

820
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
And then compiled it

821
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,680
And pushed those changes to the Joomla Repo

822
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,984
And when those changes were accepted

823
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
Into that

824
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Repo

825
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
We now

826
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:06,688
Went to the place where we found the JCB's package which in VDM's case

827
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:09,248
Is the VDM package area

828
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,344
Where if it was a community component then you would follow

829
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,184
The explanation given to you in that previous tutorial

830
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:23,328
And at this point what we going to do is we basically gonna export JCB package

831
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,168
Add it to these packages that we have here

832
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,288
And run our hash so if we look at this LSLA

833
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,336
We've got a

834
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,408
Hash sh file here

835
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
But if you run it now

836
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,016
There're should be no changes to the repo

837
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,040
And

838
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,344
Just as we expected nothing changed

839
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
So everything is up to date at the moment

840
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:50,976
And so the only file we are going to change

841
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:54,304
Is basically these three files here

842
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:59,424
Because we're gonna update this package by exporting it from JCB

843
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,728
With the changes we've made

844
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Now

845
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,080
Since you've contributed those changes to this

846
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:08,128
Question and answers

847
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,176
Joomla

848
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
A component

849
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
repository

850
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,808
Those who are gonna validate this

851
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,600
Push which we're about to make

852
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:19,904
are gonna go back to that repository

853
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,768
And make sure that you're not changing things other than we should contributed there

854
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
In fact

855
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:31,936
But some point my Anticipation is to actually build a bot which would validate this

856
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:36,032
For us so at this stage it will still be a little manuel so it will be little bit slow

857
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:41,920
but eventually will speed it up and the validation will happen faster and more efficient

858
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,968
So you in JCB

859
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,552
We now basically click on questions and answers

860
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:52,416
And there is one little snag here which I realised

861
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,208
I haven't actually resolved it

862
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:59,328
And that is that you now need to actually have the same

863
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
Key for this package

864
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:05,216
Set in the admin or rather in the component

865
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
As the one that the developer uses

866
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:13,152
And that can only be given to you by the original owner of this package

867
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:15,200
Which in this case is myself

868
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,600
So and where does that what is that mean it means that this export key

869
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
Must be the same one

870
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:26,976
As the one that the package was compiled with originally

871
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:30,816
now if you have imported this and you see a key here

872
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:34,656
You can be hundred percent sure it is not the same key

873
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
Because this is encrypted field

874
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,032
You are basically just seeing the encrypted value

875
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
Not the actual key

876
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,896
The actual key was never exported

877
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:51,296
unencrypted it always remains in crypted and that's why we have the encrypted Fields all around JCB

878
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,648
Not because we think is gonna make the database more secure necessarily

879
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,720
That is because when we export and move data around

880
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,024
That which is secret stay secret

881
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,424
And only within that specific component developing environment of those

882
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704
keys is unique

883
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:12,032
So the way you get this is you need to communicate

884
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,848
With that developer and actually ask him permission

885
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:19,968
Whether you can extend on this package and then he needs to manually give you this key

886
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,760
And so

887
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
Since I can ask that

888
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
From

889
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:30,976
From for myself I'm going to just add that key to me sure that it is the same key

890
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:33,536
With which it originally was compiled with

891
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,632
Ok so now we've got those keys to be the same

892
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:43,264
And it's sort of the way to tell everyone that you and that other developer

893
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
Are an agreement

894
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,872
That this in fact it possibly could happen

895
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,432
That once your pull request

896
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,248
To the JCB sorry to the Joomla component

897
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,016
Repo

898
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:56,320
Has been merged and accepted

899
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:58,880
Then that team needs to give you the key

900
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,184
That's how I think will work

901
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:05,792
I'm not hundred percent sure this gonna be cemented

902
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
Always got it changed

903
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:11,680
But you do realise that trust and collaboration goes hand in hand

904
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:18,336
So they need to give you the key if it's not a JCB package that actually requires a key

905
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
Then it is a different story

906
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
And yet the same sort of procedure will reply except the exchange of keys won't be necessary

907
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,624
But now that you've got the key in place we basically click here

908
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,928
And export the JCB package

909
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,792
So we now have this package

910
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,584
Here in this folder

911
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
And we now need to move it

912
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:43,168
Into the repository

913
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
Which is also

914
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,800
Obviously the one we have now synchronised with our forked version

915
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
so I have it here I'm gonna copy it

916
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:54,175
actually going cut

917
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:54,943
let's cut it

918
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:59,039
From my templer folder in my Joomla website

919
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:01,855
To this repository paste it in

920
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:04,159
And is gonna ask if we should

921
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,463
Replace and we're gonna say yes

922
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,487
Replace it

923
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,095
And then we go with got the package updated

924
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Now

925
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:15,167
We go back to command line

926
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:16,703
And we do

927
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Git

928
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
diff

929
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,079
We'll see that

930
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,871
That file is changed

931
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,711
Now we also need to run this h

932
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,015
This hash file

933
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,807
To update the

934
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:32,575
And

935
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,855
Now git

936
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,647
Status

937
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:38,463
we'll see that those files have updated

938
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
So

939
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:45,887
You would possibly I'm not sure what the vl Convention but

940
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,655
I think

941
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,983
Your pull request to the Joomla

942
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:54,079
Repository of this component

943
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:57,919
The idea of that could possibly be useful here

944
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:03,295
It's just to sort of give a heads up and validate that you did First

945
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
Contributed code

946
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,159
To the actual Joomla component and it was accepted

947
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,231
And now this is the change to the package

948
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,815
Which also now needs to be looked at

949
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
so now in our case

950
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,191
This is the pull request URL

951
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,751
 I think we just gonna use that

952
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,567
And our commit message

953
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
And

954
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,407
Use the same commit message

955
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,855
Search it looks something like this

956
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,719
Update the component with the improvements made in JCB and maybe say riff

957
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,303
And then

958
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:50,655
The repositories username or organisation name

959
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,191
The repository name

960
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,471
With this

961
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,751
 power

962
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,287
Hash one

963
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
Since it was

964
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,871
pull request was number one

965
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,663
Ok that would

966
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
Do and then

967
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:05,503
Will submit that

968
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
And

969
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:12,927
Now we push those changes to our

970
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:15,999
Version of the repository

971
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,959
Going back to git up then

972
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:27,263
after the push is been submitted

973
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,311
and we look at this commit

974
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
You see it actually has a link

975
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,687
And this link is to that issue on githup

976
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:40,319
so it'll be easy for us to trace where you have contributed it to the actual Joomla component

977
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:44,927
And why it's all happened being the same comment message

978
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,023
Now this stage you again would make a pull request

979
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
To the master branch

980
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,631
Where we will basically review

981
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,655
The changes

982
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
now Again at this stage

983
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:02,847
We don't have a pull request templates and everything in place

984
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:07,711
But as soon as they do get to be placed there and please follow those instructions

985
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,039
We'll try to be as thorough as we can

986
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:16,159
But obviously being a community is always up for discussion and we will

987
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:16,927
Try and

988
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:17,951
Do this

989
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:18,975
The right way

990
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:25,631
At the moment we can put the ref in the description and then just again the comment in the

991
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,959
Title if it's a long comment then just put

992
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,799
Maybe a summary here short one and put the wrong comment back in here

993
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,407
Ok and then you basically create the pull request

994
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:40,223
At this point discussion will begin

995
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,551
Validating to see that you followed all the procedures

996
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,903
And that this package is stable and ready to become part of the

997
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Actual

998
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:49,951
Repo

999
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,303
And then once accepted it will be merged into the master branch

1000
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,839
Become available to the rest of

1001
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
Community

1002
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
So that's

1003
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,423
At the moment

1004
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:05,311
Illustration of what I consider a collaborative workflow in JCB

1005
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,359
So we

1006
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,383
Where at

1007
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,407
Next Step

1008
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:11,711
And we had to move today JCB

1009
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,247
Where

1010
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,063
They have now accepted and merged

1011
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
The

1012
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,367
Changes you made

1013
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
To the Joomla component

1014
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,743
And now the owner has given you the original key

1015
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
Because they trust

1016
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,303
The changes you've made

1017
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
And

1018
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:31,167
you now forked the JCB package repository

1019
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:35,007
Make sure we have it in sync if it's an old fork

1020
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
Then update the key with the key from the owner

1021
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,895
Then export to JCB package

1022
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:45,247
Added to the local repo with a commit message and the reference

1023
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
As illustrated

1024
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:50,367
Then push changed to your forked repo and make a pull request

1025
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
So here

1026
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,951
Is The workflow

1027
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,487
This could

1028
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,791
Become nicely documented

1029
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
I suppose

1030
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,375
Someone can take that upon them to even

1031
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
Make some nice chart

1032
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:07,519
I maybe not the correct guy for the job

1033
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
And this might

1034
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,639
Expand and become maybe much more advanced

1035
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:15,199
or it could be made more simple

1036
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,247
But in a nutshell

1037
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:18,527
just

1038
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:21,087
Below an hour

1039
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,879
We've 47 minutes

1040
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
 sort of

1041
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:28,255
This is the explanation of the collaborative

1042
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,071
Workflow with external

1043
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,375
Partners

1044
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:35,679
Around a JCB package

1045
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:39,519
Once this pull request gets merged we are basically back

1046
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
At the

1047
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,335
This is in sync

1048
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,103
And

1049
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
This is in sync

1050
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:47,967
And this will continue and I'll go on and on

1051
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,039
And obviously others will contribute so

1052
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,599
There there are some other complexities also

1053
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,647
In this process

1054
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,719
But that is sort of what I can see happening

1055
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,047
I know that when you

1056
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:06,655
Pull the changes from the previous package you know this

1057
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
Where is it

1058
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:12,031
You know the import the JCB package

1059
00:48:12,287 --> 00:48:15,103
There is the option to import it as a clone

1060
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,663
Order import it with a merge

1061
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:23,039
Now the idea would be that you will only import and merge your JCB package

1062
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:26,111
With the global Repo

1063
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
As they accept

1064
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,415
These pull request

1065
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:30,719
And so that

1066
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:35,839
You would always stay in sync with what actually is currently the community version

1067
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
Of the package

1068
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:43,775
And you could import it it as a clone and make changes to the Clone and effect that will not effect

1069
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,823
 the Main Master

1070
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,847
Version

1071
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:50,687
But this all is a trial and error process which

1072
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
You would

1073
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,015
Sort of show you teach yourself how that works

1074
00:48:55,295 --> 00:49:00,671
And so my idea is to do that within a blank install try it out

1075
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,719
Pulling some of the free versions

1076
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
But play around with it

1077
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,047
Until you become confident

1078
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,119
And then you are able to also start contributing

1079
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,423
Do not only the community packages

1080
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,751
But also VDM packages to which you've got access

1081
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,591
And so help improve those components

1082
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,615
For everyone

1083
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
Well thanks for watching

1084
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,199
Hope this is insightful

1085
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:27,807
And I'm sure there might be things that some of you would not able to follow

1086
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:30,367
And I would encourage you to just Google that

1087
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,415
and do some tutorials and

1088
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,719
Then you I'm sure you will

1089
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
Manage

1090
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:37,023
ok Thanks for watching
