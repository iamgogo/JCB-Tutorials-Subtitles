00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:04,864
Now we'll look at adding custom admin view to a component

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,728
We'll make use of cost-benefit projection

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,800
As our component

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,080
And then we

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,104
Go to settings

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,688
And then we'll go to custom admin views

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:19,968
And we'll see oh let's just

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,760
Close that

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
open again

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,624
Now will see you there has to custom admin views added

12
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
Now

13
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:34,560
It has more switches than the site view because of its implementation being more dynamic

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,120
You can choose an icon

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,656
Because in the backend

16
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,704
You possibly

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
want to have an icon when your on that page

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,056
on the right

19
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:45,824
of the page

20
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,920
Then you can decide where this should show in the main menu

21
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:54,528
Selective if you should show in the main menu the main menu

22
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:58,624
Is a menu that drops down out of Joomla's menu item list

23
00:00:58,880 --> 00:00:59,392
Right

24
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
And then the dashboard

25
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,232
Which is that

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,840
Dashboard we go to every time when we start with a component that

27
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
All the icons are showing up

28
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,984
Then the submenu is the one on the on the left

29
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,312
Which you see when you are in a view

30
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:22,432
So these are all placements where you can possibly add

31
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
This

32
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Custom View

33
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,088
Now if you remember

34
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
The company

35
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,184
Results we didn't add

36
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,464
to

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,488
Any of the

38
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:41,120
Views individually we added to items so that's why all of these are set to no

39
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,656
And

40
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:45,728
That means we are targeting an item

41
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,264
In a view

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
And so all we need to do a select the view which we are targeting

43
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
Which is company

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
And we say ok

45
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
It has metadata yes or no

46
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:59,040
And it has access yes or no

47
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
And

48
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
That's basically it

49
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,136
To ensure that

50
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,488
Targets the correct view is simply by selecting company here

51
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
If I close this for a moment

52
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
And then open that component

53
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:15,168
Show you what is happened with the settings

54
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,984
So here we have that component open

55
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,520
If I was to open

56
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Companies over here

57
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,896
You see that has a button here

58
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,688
for company result

59
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:27,968
Now

60
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,808
If you remember when we set up this custom admin

61
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
View

62
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,392
We we ensured that

63
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,464
We are targeting an item ID

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,608
And by selecting company we are saying we are targeting this company's item

65
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
ID

66
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
And that is what makes it work

67
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,264
And then we said we want to see a chart

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
I'm so if we look at these this little charts what shows up in

69
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
The icon itself

70
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,480
We click on it

71
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
We see the custom view shows up and that icon shows up next to it

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
And all works well

73
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,024
We also see that there is a combined results

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
Button showing up here in the toolbar

75
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
And that is because combined results

76
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,216
Which selected we want cogs

77
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,544
To be the icon

78
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,568
And we set

79
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
List of records is set to yes

80
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,944
And has metadata

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
And has access and also company

82
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
And so

83
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
These selections before

84
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:42,464
Is only really necessary when you select main menu and submenu

85
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,280
Because then you want to say before what

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,840
Item you want this

87
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Menu to be created

88
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,264
Now we selected dashboard list of Records

89
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,800
And because of that

90
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
It places that in here

91
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,968
And you need to select the records that you want to look at

92
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
And then you can click on the combined results

93
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,112
And they'll grab those IDs and

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:14,720
Since we are modelling a data in the controller and the model

95
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,536
It gives back to the view these results

96
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,119
Through the custom implementation we've done

97
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
So

98
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,447
Just a quick refresher

99
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:27,007
If we go to component Builder

100
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,567
And custom admin views

101
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
and we open company results

102
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,991
We see that in the custom button

103
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
We added the PHP

104
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,343
We also added the button

105
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
We explain to

106
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,975
To component builder what we what kind of buttons we want

107
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,815
So we set we are targeting a single item you see those

108
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:55,423
Edit company go to company now those buttons

109
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
are

110
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
Actually related to

111
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Going inside of the view

112
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
And

113
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
Then if you come out of this

114
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,735
We saw that even and combined results

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
We also added buttons

116
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:15,903
But again those buttons Vcard companies gotocompanies

117
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,719
corresponds to this controller

118
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,047
And if we go to the view itself

119
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:33,311
And we'll see that that's not responding to this button but actually

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:37,407
To the buttons inside called companies and edit

121
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,271
Those that's the buttons you were building in the custom View

122
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:44,831
Where is the buttons we are looking at in here

123
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,159
Is related to opening the custom view itself

124
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
So

125
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,743
That is just a quick

126
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,767
Refresher

127
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:56,095
Same goes with the combined results

128
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:01,983
The combined results is the button that you are setting up here

129
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,567
Where is the other buttons are once you have combined them

130
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
And you've click combined results

131
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
You see that it adds two buttons dashboard and companies and those two buttons was set up in the view it

132
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
Self

133
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:20,415
So that you can know and sort of

134
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,207
Understand what

135
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:24,767
Area controls what set of buttons

136
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
This area controls the buttons before opening

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,983
the view where is in the view the buttons your setting up there is for when you have opened the view

138
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,335
Ok so that is setting up a custom admin View

139
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
To your component

140
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:44,223
And some of the switches obviously again

141
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,087
If anything is unclear or you not exactly sure

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
You can obviously come on and do anything

143
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:58,559
So simply go change it to what you would think should work and compile a component and go look in the code

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,887
And see what has been done and look and the

145
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,423
Joomla

146
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,703
if the face

147
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
See what is being displayed

148
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,823
And play around with it until you get that what you expected

149
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,151
Just a quick heads up this

150
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,247
ordering before is only compulsory when

151
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:21,343
Actually selecting add to main menu or add sub menu

152
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,647
And if you use those

153
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,927
It means

154
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
That

155
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,463
If

156
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
If you go to your component

157
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,119
You have the icons area and here in the top you have your your

158
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,399
Your

159
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,191
Main menu items

160
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
And once you've opened

161
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:38,751
A

162
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,079
Then you're here on the right you have sub menu

163
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,919
So this is main menu this is dash list

164
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
Now dash list is that one which goes to the top

165
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,063
Of the

166
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
Of the components

167
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Toolbar

168
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,951
and then submenu is the one here on the side

169
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,767
So if if this

170
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
Custom admin view is simply needs to be placed in the submenu and its lives on its own it's not related to any other

171
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,703
Dataset

172
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,031
Then you can use the submenu method if you only wanna

173
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
Featured in the main menu these are all the features that you could set

174
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Where is the dashboard

175
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
List record

176
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:21,759
Feature

177
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Helps you to sort of

178
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
Link it to a specific set

179
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
Of

180
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,415
Data data structures like

181
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Like this one does

182
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,023
So you can select these ids and when when you click

183
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
On this combined results the ids of the selected items gets passed

184
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,727
to the controller

185
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,543
And if I go back to that quickly

186
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,127
Show you that how we use it

187
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
Combined results

188
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,759
Custom button

189
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
You basically see that

190
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:59,135
Go to companies

191
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,183
Is not in here

192
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:12,191
So we see we're using the main get called companies data get list query

193
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,799
So let's go look at that data query I think that's we will find

194
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:19,615
The use of the implementation of those ids

195
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:29,343
So we see we are basically reaching into the

196
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Input array

197
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
Array sorry object here

198
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
We getting CID

199
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
Selected ids

200
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
And we saying

201
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,119
It can be SMD

202
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
And

203
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,727
Then we are exploding it and

204
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:48,287
We are making sure it is intervals

205
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,103
And we placing it in ids

206
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,199
And so this actually gets the value

207
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:55,967
From the post

208
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,783
Object

209
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
And

210
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,647
Places that into ids and here we do some validation

211
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
To ensure that the person who's trying to access

212
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:06,975
the data has actualy the right

213
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
To do it

214
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,559
And once we past that

215
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
We basically use those ids

216
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
to

217
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
to get

218
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,031
The data so in in the filter

219
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:23,103
We use ids

220
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,895
And check whether

221
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
All the IDs

222
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
Are in a ID and that in the code

223
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
Basically if you look at the code

224
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
It's on the models combine results

225
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:40,511
We see that it uses our checking method here

226
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Later

227
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,071
down here

228
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,863
It checks the IDs

229
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:49,215
Puts it array check if it's in array then implodes it

230
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,751
And checks whether it is

231
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,055
You know only gets those IDs

232
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:56,895
That's how we we filtered the dataset

233
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
With the results

234
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
of the selection

235
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
And

236
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
So

237
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,319
That's just a little bit looking into the backend

238
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
On how to make use of those

239
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
Features and again as you can see it's some custom scripting we added to the dynamic get method

240
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,863
To take those ids and to use them

241
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
In the way we intend

242
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
now you you can ignore them

243
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,287
But here is the way that I implemented it

244
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
If you wanna drop that down pause the video

245
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,687
And copy some of this area here

246
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,479
Think would be the only part that will be

247
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,319
Useful to your purpose

248
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
And then you can use the IDs in your code

249
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
As you please

250
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,999
And know that this PHP as you saw

251
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,535
In the code

252
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,095
It runs before the get methods

253
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
So it basically is a filtering option as you see there

254
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
So then this query starts

255
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,079
Then that code be wrote

256
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
Is entered in here and then the rest of the code which is

257
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
build by component Builder

258
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:07,295
Is being done and you can use a filter option with whatever you

259
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,831
Collected up here

260
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,623
Ok so that's

261
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:15,487
Looking into adding custom admin views to component Builder

262
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,815
And just showing you again the tremendous

263
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,863
Leverage and

264
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,935
Design choices you can make

265
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,751
In ensuring that your component is dynamic

266
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
And

267
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
Get sort of breaks out of the mould

268
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,639
So that you can achieve

269
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,663
Nice

270
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Complex components

271
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,735
Write inside component Builder

272
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
Thank you for watching
