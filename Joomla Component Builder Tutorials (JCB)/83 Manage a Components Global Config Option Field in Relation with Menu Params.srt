1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,072
I would like to give you the tutorial

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:04,096
How to

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,888
Manage your

4
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,912
Global

5
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
Options

6
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,312
Also known as the global configuration options

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,104
Of a component

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,176
As some of you may already know

9
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,272
The global configuration options is also

10
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,088
The same area where you are able to set

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,880
The menu option

12
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:30,464
Of a specific site View

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,024
So I'm gonna demonstrate some of that to you

14
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
We want to actually achieve

15
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,680
An understanding on how to

16
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,240
Control where which of these

17
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,008
Fields

18
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:43,776
Appear

19
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:49,920
You see because you might want to have the field appear in your Global options after component

20
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,456
But not in the menu

21
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,504
Or you might want to have it

22
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,784
Appear in the menu

23
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,552
But not in

24
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,320
And the global option

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,904
And so there is ways to achieve that

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,208
And so I wanna demonstrate that

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:08,864
And also give a little general overview because I was looking for the tutorial Where I've done this

28
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Before

29
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
And

30
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:15,008
Yeah it's a classic example of dealing with to many issues in one

31
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,288
Tutorial so

32
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
I actually couldn't find it

33
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
So I'm gonna redo this and

34
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,432
I know it's there somewhere but

35
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:27,552
Ok this will stand out so people find it easily so let's see

36
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,160
Joomla components I've got a component to your called member manager

37
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
If I open it

38
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:39,584
It's also got a lot of config file Fields already setup. So let's look at that.

39
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,960
So I've got some Global fields

40
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:48,032
There is a site view called members

41
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,616
Which actually also already has

42
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,688
A number of fields as you can see here

43
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
And

44
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,320
That means they are actually also we can also look at some of them

45
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,928
I'm gonna demonstrate adding one because to me

46
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,208
That's most

47
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
Explanatory

48
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,072
Then there's some company value data and stuff ok

49
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
So there's a lot of config values already here

50
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Usually if there is none you're just click on 

51
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,008
this plus and start adding

52
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
The fields now

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,152
It's really in the field that a lot of the control is managed

54
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
So if I go out of here

55
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
And I go to the fields

56
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,112
And let's let's open some of those

57
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
Field

58
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,464
Like for example

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864
We have this members the first one is member display type list so it is this one

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,912
Let's open that one

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,984
And so basically see normal

62
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Members display type

63
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,824
And then

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,872
Basically nothing

65
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Unique

66
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Now

67
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
If I compile this component

68
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,600
install it

69
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,184
And now let's go look

70
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,976
At that component quickly

71
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
And it's global options

72
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,144
We see it has only 1, 2

73
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,264
3 Fields showing here so the 3 field showing here

74
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,128
But in our list there are quite a lot more

75
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,736
So let's look at some of the fields that don't show up in the config area

76
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
So like let's see

77
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:38,368
It is panel template

78
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,904
Panel

79
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,464
panels, panel and then displayed type

80
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
So

81
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,584
That means this table row template isn't there

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,168
This table template isn't there oh wait

83
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Maybe they are

84
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,264
Let's see if I change this

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,056
Oh yeah they are there

86
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,128
So there are a few hidden

87
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Fields

88
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
Working along here

89
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
So let's scroll down

90
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,648
Target member types that one isn't there

91
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,464
Components 1to1 link

92
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,232
to

93
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,280
JMM multi custom

94
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
That one isn't

95
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
There

96
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,863
And this one too many

97
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:27,007
Is also not there ok so let's go look at that in the fields area

98
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,615
So here is the component 1 to many linked

99
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
To JMM

100
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,199
Joomla member manager

101
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
First scroll down

102
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,343
I see a few options here

103
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:48,255
For now we'll see that there is in this extra properties area

104
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,583
There's a new property added called display

105
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
And it set to menu

106
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:59,775
I'll be here you can read about this this actual property there are a few

107
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:05,919
And it says display switch for Dynamic placement in relation to the use

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,015
Of the field in menu and global configuration options

109
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
So that means if this field gets used in

110
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
The menu or in Global configuration

111
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:18,719
You can switch it on and off

112
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,047
 to be either in the one or the other

113
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:25,631
With leaving this blank like not having it in all

114
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
We'll put it into both

115
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
Which was the default way used to always work

116
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
So

117
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:37,407
So the config option will only add the field to the global configuration area

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:42,015
Where is the menu will add the field only to the

119
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
To the menu area

120
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:48,415
Which means this field is only being added

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,695
To the menu area

122
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
So let's see if that so

123
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,655
So here in the global configuration of the manager it on the members it is not

124
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,727
Visible no matter which choice we make here

125
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
It's still not visible

126
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,151
If we select member manager members

127
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,711
You see there is a new tab here

128
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
And here it is actually showing up

129
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,319
Component one to one

130
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,415
So here it is active where as in the

131
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Global config it is not

132
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
So that is

133
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Really as simple as it is

134
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
In adding a

135
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
Field

136
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
To just

137
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Menu is to select display

138
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,311
And add the string menu here exactly as spelled there

139
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:42,175
Or config now if you want it in both like I said you just leave this out like

140
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:48,575
You don't even need to add anything where is if you want it only in config you would add 

141
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,903
Config string in the value here

142
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Ok so let's do that

143
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Let's create a field

144
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
We say new

145
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
give it a name

146
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
Show title

147
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
Select an option we wanna do radio

148
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Radio field

149
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,591
Then I'm just gonna add these properties

150
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,015
So as name we set show title as label show title

151
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:24,159
Select if the title should be shown and yes no the default being one

152
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,791
And for now we gonna leave off any other settings here and just save this

153
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:37,727
Then the going back to our member manager we can open the config

154
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:43,359
And add this new tab in here

155
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:50,783
So we just clicked + here the way we know how to add this tab name

156
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,623
Is it must be the exact same name as the site view

157
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
Where we want the menu

158
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,463
Value to be added

159
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,487
So

160
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:04,351
So we gonna add the correct site view now we here we selecting the field

161
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Which we've just created

162
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
So I'm going to add it to the cpanel

163
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,311
And show title and the default again I'm adding it here as one

164
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
And we can save and close out of here

165
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,783
Now let's compile this component and see what happens

166
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,135
and install

167
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,743
Now I'm going back to the go configurations

168
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,375
We have this tab called cpanel and it says show title

169
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
And it's yes or no

170
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,471
And that's quite to be expected

171
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
But now going to the menu

172
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,103
And instead of selecting

173
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,663
Members I'm going to select

174
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Cpanel

175
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,063
and again shows me this member manager tab but now

176
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
It says show title and he has this use Global

177
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,671
Yes or no

178
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:04,511
So you can use Global just leave that or you could say no

179
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,047
Which is a local overwrite

180
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,863
Yes would also be a local overwrite

181
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
So

182
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
This way

183
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,471
Your parameters in your menu

184
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:18,591
It overwrites either falls back to the global setting of the components configuration

185
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:22,431
Or it overwrites it here on this menu level

186
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,063
Ok now we want to change the field so it doesn't show up in the menu

187
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,647
Which is quite simple we go down here

188
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
And we

189
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
Again

190
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
Select the display option

191
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:41,375
and I wanna it only to be in the config area so we add the word config here

192
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
And save

193
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,519
Then we go back and compile an install this component just again

194
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,823
Now back in the menu

195
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
We need to just refresh this page here

196
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
Basically make sure we have

197
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,271
Cpanel selected

198
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,855
And as you can see the values no longer showing here

199
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,415
There's no longer that Xtra tab

200
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
Where is in member manager if I was to refresh this area

201
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,351
The cpanel tab is still there and that option is still available

202
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,703
Now I can go back and change this from config

203
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
to

204
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:19,775
Menu

205
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Again

206
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,847
just save this

207
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,919
And go back compile and install

208
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
Now going back to the menu

209
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:34,367
If I refresh this menu suddenly we have member manager back and has

210
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Show title

211
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:39,487
But now you see it no longer has the global option

212
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:45,887
This is a fix in the latest release it's still in staging version

213
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,447
2.9.15

214
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
Suppose it will come out in 16 so this is a fix we've noticed that it used to still add global

215
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
Here

216
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
While there is no longer a global value

217
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,223
So we have fix this

218
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:04,319
But so from here on forward it should be resolved

219
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:08,671
Now if we go back to the global configuration area

220
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
And we refresh this area

221
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
Then suddenly the

222
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,607
Cpanel tab is gone

223
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:20,703
We we don't see it and that means that the value itself also

224
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
It's still in the database

225
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
If you

226
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,151
If you've saved it previously and you've done this it's still in the database now the only way to quickly get it out

227
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
Just click save here

228
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
Oh and we've got some empty values we need to fill before we can so that's just a little

229
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,391
Demonstration

230
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:42,975
From my side on how to adapt

231
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,255
The

232
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
Actual

233
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
Config of your component

234
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,119
This area

235
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
To be able to add Fields to it

236
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,079
Is quite easy but to be able to add this Fields to site views so

237
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
If I show you this if I say a site view

238
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:01,919
I mean

239
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
That this component

240
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,015
If we would open it

241
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,111
In the site views it actually has

242
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,415
A site view called cpanel

243
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,487
See also members the one we looked at

244
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
And so

245
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
The cpanel

246
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,583
Is its name

247
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,447
If you aren't sure about what that name is you can go to site views

248
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,007
And to that specific

249
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,567
Site view this name here

250
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,103
That says name

251
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,431
That is the name of the tag you must use

252
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,967
And so

253
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,527
That means your Fields behaviour

254
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Is literally controlled

255
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
In the field itself

256
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
And

257
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
Yes that means if you would to add this field to multiple components it will be actually behaving

258
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Similar

259
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,399
In every one of those components

260
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:00,799
Meaning if you've add this to be menu it will only be loaded to menu

261
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:07,455
But if you add this field to a site view or sorry to an admin View

262
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:10,783
It doesn't actually react to this display

263
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,551
Value

264
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:15,391
Then then this display property is no longer

265
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,439
Really being used

266
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,487
It's only Active

267
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
When it is lined up in a few points that is first that it's belongs to

268
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
a tab

269
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:30,751
Which also has a site view of the same name

270
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:32,543
Secondly

271
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,823
That it

272
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,151
Is in the configurations therefore of course

273
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
So it needs to be a configuration field

274
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:42,015
That belongs to a tab

275
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:47,391
Which has a site view of the same name then these display

276
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,951
Property actually kicks in

277
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,999
Otherwise it's simply ignored

278
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
And so you could use this fields in

279
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,143
Menus sorry not me

280
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
in admin views

281
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,727
And then this value won't play a role

282
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,287
It's only when it becomes a config field

283
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Ok well thanks for watching

284

if you see some

287
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,015
Room for improvement
