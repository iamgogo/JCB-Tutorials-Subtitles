00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,048
Hi everyone

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,144
We again have a great announcement to make

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,216
JCB has again been expanded

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,824
To now include a language translation

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
Feature

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,480
We are very grateful one of the contributors have

7
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,784
Extended the code base for this

8
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
We obviously

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,368
Working together to

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
insure that it remains stable

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,744
Those of you that been following

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,792
The process on GitHub

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:34,816
Will know that

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,096
As much time and effort

15
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,120
Put into this

16
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:40,704
So I would like to give you a quick explanation

17
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
Of how this will work

18
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:46,592
those of you that are already using JCB

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,408
or ACB depends on

20
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,784
We are asking ACB Advanced Component Builder JCB Joomla component Builder

21
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
It is

22
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
Actually a English component

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
And

24
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,512
It builds the English

25
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
Language file for you

26
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,376
So every where in your fields

27
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,424
When you create a field

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,104
There  are areas in the in the field

29
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:21,664
That says that it's translatable

30
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:25,248
Translatable not translatable translatable

31
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
And if you enter those values here

32
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,928
JCB on the fly would take this description for example

33
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,000
and will convert it into a language placeholder

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,304
and will add it to the language file

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
The English language file

36
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
The British one

37
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Now

38
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,960
This is all being done automatically

39
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
For every area of the JCB

40
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
Compiler

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,664
Even in templates and views

42
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
That's now your front end

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
If you create

44
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
you know site views

45
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,856
And even templates and layouts

46
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880
You can

47
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
Just adding

48
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
These placeholders these Jtext with the actual English language string in it

49
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:17,216
Then the passer will automatically grab that text and add it to the language file

50
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,240
So

51
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,056
So currently JCB is building

52
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,640
A complete English

53
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Language

54
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
File for you

55
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,504
And that means it's

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
Already able to

57
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
translate it

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,672
But it has not had the feature for you to add

59
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:39,232
Multiple other languages

60
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
And so that is really what has been the request

61
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
The request is

62
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
Isn't there a way we could

63
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936
Actually Translate

64
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,472
This language strings

65
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,104
And then when JCB compiles the component it will automatically add these other languages

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
And so

67
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,176
The

68
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
The suggestion was

69
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
That we basically

70
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
Add an area where you can

71
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,392
Create as many languages as you like

72
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,720
Obviously in accordance with the conventions

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,512
Your language tags

74
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:17,632
Need to be in in accordance with the correct prefixes used in Joomla

75
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
So

76
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,960
I think we could add a link here

77
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:26,336
Maybe on this page some point just to take you somewhere where you can find all the information to

78
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
To use the correct

79
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
Tagging

80
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,736
For your language file

81
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,552
And here you could obviously add the language name

82
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
So you can create as many languages as you like

83
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Then

84
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
When you compile a component

85
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,560
JCB obviously like I have explained

86
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
Grabs all the strings from everywhere

87
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
And

88
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:56,544
Adds to the British English translation file now let me show you some of that

89
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,080
Happening in the code

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
So here in the Get

91
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,456
Class

92
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
We have a function called setLangStrings

93
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,416
It basically gets the content from wherever JCB is handing it

94
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,208
And it parses it

95
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
To see whether it has

96
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,327
Either this language string or that one

97
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,471
Then it does some gymnastics here to grab all the actual strings into an array

98
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
then it parses this array

99
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,311
Once it has it

100
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,591
And it converts it

101
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
To a language string

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,919
And it adds it back

103
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,247
Into the content and returns the content and then

104
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
With this

105
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,183
We call it an object array

106
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,743
It is adding the language string

107
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
And the language key

108
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,607
To the langContent array

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
So that's a first thing we have this langContent array

110
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
It's all over the place and it just gets

111
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:01,055
bulkier and bulkier

112
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,871
Now the lang is basically the target

113
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
It's the area

114
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
Which this lang strings belong to either the site

115
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
or the

116
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,623
Cite system or the admin or the admin system area

117
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,023
So there are four areas where the site this language string all there is also such a thing as both

118
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
While JCP compiles

119
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,631
Some strings he knows must go to both

120
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:30,495
And this is the actual language string be capitalised string

121
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,543
Which is generated up here

122
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
And

123
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:34,847
This is then

124
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,151
I trimmed and placed in it's

125
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
place

126
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Now

127
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
this array

128
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Gets

129
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,623
Placed into the files at a certain Point

130
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:54,303
That point is very much at the very end of the compilation of course when everything is being sort of

131
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Done

132
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
We actually get to the place where

133
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
We gonna now add two strings to the files

134
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
So first we are basically

135
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,639
Calling a function called setLangAdmin setLangSys basically

136
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
This is in the interpreter

137
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,207
You can see these these methods are here setLangSite

138
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
Here is setLangAdmin

139
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:31,679
Basically adds a bunch of strings that are default always being added

140
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,471
And then

141
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,775
Also all the other strings have been built

142
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
And then

143
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:40,127
Moves them over to a string called language

144
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,711
And obviously the British English and it's for the admin area

145
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
And so it does for all the various areas

146
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,879
And in the infusion class it brings it together

147
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
And then we grab the values of this strings

148
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
We added to our value array

149
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,327
And we basically

150
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,935
Have the old multi language implementation running down

151
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
From here from line

152
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
197

153
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,127
We start running into the multi language string implementation

154
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Now what does this do

155
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,455
Basically

156
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,503
It queries the database

157
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:22,367
To see whether there is such a English language string in the database

158
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:26,207
And whether there is been any translations made for it

159
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,791
So doesn't really use the place holders

160
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:35,423
Because the place holders are so ambiguous between various components and our idea was

161
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:42,079
To prevent a very bloated oversized database we must try to share strings amongst

162
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Components

163
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,687
And so currently when you compile a component it

164
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,015
Gathers it's English strings like I have explained

165
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:55,647
And then it checks the database whether these English strings already exist in the database

166
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:59,743
And if they do it then checks whether they have

167
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
Translations already linked to them

168
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
And if they do

169
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,959
Then it starts grabbing that translation strings and adds them

170
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
To this

171
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:14,079
Language object array

172
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
Also by tag and by area and then here we are basically parsing this array so by this time

173
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
Time we ready have all the languages

174
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,159
In place and we are now able to put them into the component

175
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
So

176
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,023
It's basically these functions get multiple strings

177
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:35,583
A multi language strings

178
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,423
setLangPlaceholders ,purgeLanguageStrings

179
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,727
These are the functions

180
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
That actually does the work

181
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,359
So you could go look at these they are all found in the get

182
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,455
class the one where everything really starts

183
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
They are found there and you can look at them they are

184
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,623
All their doings are are

185
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,927
Obviously open source so you can see

186
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:06,047
Now so that means by the point we get to this line 1109

187
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,607
We already have all the language strings

188
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,887
In their various

189
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,215
Areas and various languages

190
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,799
And we can now start adding them back into the component

191
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
And that's really what this

192
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Part is doing

193
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
It just adding it into the component

194
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
So

195
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
Now let's go back to the user interface to see this in action

196
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,623
So I'm gonna compile a component

197
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,183
Just any component

198
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
Let's say this document manager

199
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,815
And while I'm compiling it

200
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,631
So keep in mind it will be running through

201
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:45,983
And grabbing all the English strings then eventually will check

202
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,263
This

203
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
Language translation table

204
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,127
Weather no strings

205
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,407
Actually exist

206
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
And if I do if they've been translated

207
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
Ok so that's basically as simple as that

208
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
It compiles it

209
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:01,855
And

210
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,903
It does most of the work for you

211
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
Now the question has been asked

212
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,767
What if

213
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
You've changed some

214
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
Fields name or some description

215
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,655
And now

216
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:17,215
That other description that Old English

217
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:18,495
String

218
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,287
Is no longer being used

219
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,823
What what then

220
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,871
Well at the moment

221
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,663
It will basically be purged

222
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
Now the purging works as follow

223
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
When it

224
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:34,111
Discovers that is string is no longer being used by a component

225
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
We can go in the cone and I can show you that

226
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:39,999
Then

227
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
It basically asks the question

228
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
Is another component still using it

229
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,399
Ok

230
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
so if more components are using it

231
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,007
and if another component is using it

232
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,103
It simply removes the current component from the string

233
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,943
And then it it goes on , it doesn't

234
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
Remove it

235
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:03,551
If no other component is using it so let's say

236
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
No all the component is any longer

237
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
Linked to the string

238
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,975
Then it checks whether there has been any work done in it

239
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Has there been translation done

240
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,583
I mean it's quite a

241
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
Huge job to do translation

242
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,727
So we figured if you've done it you wouldn't want to just delete it

243
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,775
So what we will do then

244
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,823
As we basically archive

245
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:26,591
The string

246
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
We move it from the published State

247
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:35,807
Do it archived State so you can go to archives and then there see all the strings that no longer

248
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
Are actively linked to a component

249
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,415
But has translations in it

250
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
And if it does not have any translation

251
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
So you've seen it's not link to a component

252
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,607
And it does not have translation

253
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,679
Then we remove the string from the database

254
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,287
So these are the two functions to remove the string completely

255
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,615
And so it's like it never it was there in the first place

256
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
And so that is really how The Purge works at the moment it only purges That which really is no longer linked

257
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Neither has any work done in it

258
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
And

259
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
So

260
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
That is what's happening at the moment

261
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,303
Ok so now if we were to go to this component in JCB

262
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,119
So the document manager

263
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
You see there is a new tab called translation

264
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,615
And in this tab it shows you all the English strings

265
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:38,527
Whether it's been having any work done in it so it will say no translation when the work has been done to it

266
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,343
And in how many components it's been used

267
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,623
So currently

268
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:47,487
Most of these strings as you see are used in quite a few other components

269
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
And now you can from here

270
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
Click on any of these strings

271
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
And

272
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,215
It will give you the list of all the components where it's used

273
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,543
it show you the string but you cannot edit the string here

274
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:05,663
But you can add translations so here you'll select the language and you will add the translation

275
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:09,503
And you can add as many as you like to the string

276
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:10,527
And

277
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,367
Then every one of these components this translation will be Active

278
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,671
So

279
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
That is really how

280
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
The translation manager works

281
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:26,911
There are two ways to get to the strings the one is like a show you via the component

282
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:29,471
And we are planning

283
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,775
To add a button here

284
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,079
Whereby you can import

285
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,967
these and export these strings quite easily so that you could give them to other team members

286
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,111
who can then make translations give back to you and you just import them here and then it gets linked automatically

287
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
So that is still under development

288
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,975
It should come out soon within the next.........

289
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Let me not give any promises

290
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,351
Soon as we have the time

291
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,399
And

292
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:02,751
So to make it easier to do these translations

293
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,335
The other way to get to these translations

294
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,431
Is to Simply go to language translations

295
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,527
And here you'll find all the components strings together

296
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:18,367
So this could become a database

297
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,439
With over 8000 lines I'm suppose

298
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:27,583
But like you see it's working quite well I've already got a lot of components

299
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
Mapped

300
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,447
The ones that you see usually are the ones that are active

301
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
Which I'm working on

302
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,543
I've got quite a few in archive is well

303
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,847
So the reality is

304
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
 I've been testing this against

305
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
you know

306
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:47,295
say 8 or 9 components at the same time sharing strings among each other

307
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
And I expect this feature to become quite powerful

308
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,743
Soon as we are able to you know speed up the translation method

309
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,071
There is been suggestions that we also

310
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,215
Add this feature to a sort of a community area somewhere

311
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:10,591
Where we you can push your English strings there and you can pull

312
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,663
Already translated strings from it

313
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
I know this is a great idea but how to manage that so that we don't find people abusing the system

314
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
are Still under the debate

315
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,791
So anyone have any good suggestions please go to GitHub and open a issue and let's start talking

316
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,071
Well

317
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
I hope this is enough explanation

318
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
On how to do

319
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
Multiple language implementation on your components in Joomla component Builder

320
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,711
I'm quite happy about this new feature I really think it will

321
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,991
In the long run

322
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,295
Become a very valuable asset

323
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Anyway

324
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,855
Thank you 

325
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:54,879
Very much for watching

326
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:55,903
Goodbye
