1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:04,352
The option to now add your own custom dashboard

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,704
To your component has actually finally come

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:14,336
I might have mentioned this in some previous tutorials but it's somewhat hidden

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,920
So I thought Well let's do it quick tutorial just about this

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
So in the past all components basically it's layout ended up as the dashboard looking like this

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
Obviously with your own icons

7
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:31,744
But you could do only about what you see here

8
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,560
And this is still the default dashboard

9
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,352
So if you don't add your own

10
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,400
You're basically Build this for you

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:43,008
Based on your Fields based on it's icons and layout selection

12
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:46,592
So you could add tabs like we have here

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:49,408
And these tabs are quite powerful

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,456
You can really

15
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:53,760
Add

16
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
A lot of

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
Functionality within that

18
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:02,464
But for some of you this might be boring and not really what you would like in fact you wanna look different

19
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,560
You don't want your component to look like it was built with JCB

20
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,400
And I don't blame you because that is what makes components

21
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
Valuable

22
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,240
Is that they are actually unique

23
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,896
And that is really why JCB exists it exist because I didn't want a cookie cutter component

24
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:26,272
I wanted to build my own components that actually look different from

25
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,088
Each other in yet have similar

26
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,648
Behaviour because of my company's approach

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,184
But

28
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
None of the others out there actually

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
Could do that for me

30
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
They all

31
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
We ended up looking

32
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Just like

33
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
The one

34
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,424
We were using

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
So now with JCB

36
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,752
We constantly

37
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:52,640
Trying to make sure that this is not the case in fact that's why the site view area is it a bit more difficult

38
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
Because you wanna give you

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
The opportunity to express your components functionality

40
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,576
In a way that's unique to you

41
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,208
This might be a challenge but in the long run believe me it is the advantage

42
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,792
If you could do it without knowing

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
Any Javascript with CSS or HTML

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,936
Then anyone else can do it as well

45
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,496
So there is like a little bit of a

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Yeah incentive to sort of

47
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,640
Get your head around some of these Technologies

48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,760
And any case to be a good component developer and not knowing PHP

49
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
And those

50
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,088
Front-end languages

51
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,672
Is most certainly a risk ok

52
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
Well

53
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,024
So without any further ado if we were to go

54
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,584
We'll have your this common known

55
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608
Hello World

56
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
Component

57
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
and if we would to

58
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
Open it in the website now

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
This is it dashboard

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
Now it doesn't have a custom dashboard

61
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
And

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:01,248
I'm not gonna add one at this point but I am gonna

63
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,528
Take-away

64
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
The dashboard it has and

65
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,368
So then it's sort of behaves

66
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,928
Like the article manager for example

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,304
If we would go here there's an in the components area there is a new tab or rather

68
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
a tab called

69
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,888
 Dash&Install

70
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,192
You see here it has the default

71
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
And then here

72
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
It has some description of what that means

73
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
If you click on dynamic

74
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
It actually gives you a list of all the available

75
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,224
Sites

76
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,552
Views that are linked to the component

77
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,112
And that would be custom admin views

78
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
As well as

79
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,208
Normal admin views it will show you a list of them all

80
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,512
And you can then select

81
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,536
Any of those

82
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,864
And that will become the new dashboard for your component

83
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
So basically save and close

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,264
And go to the compiler and compile the

85
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,288
Hello World

86
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,824
Component

87
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
And basically just reinstall

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,992
So to demonstrate how that changed our components behaviour

89
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
So

90
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,320
we're going to install

91
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
Then we will

92
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:15,232
Basically go to components and click on

93
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,280
This hello world link

94
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,119
To see what it does now as its default dashboard

95
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,727
And so it loads the listview and the dashboard is gone

96
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,775
So from this point forward

97
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
Your Hello World Component

98
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
Actually

99
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Looks like this

100
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,175
And it doesn't have a dashboard

101
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,503
Now you could use a custom dashboard

102
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:40,575
Which and In our case

103
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:42,367
If you

104
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,159
If you're using

105
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
A component

106
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:48,255
That has custom admin views

107
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,047
So JCB has

108
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:54,911
The compiler and the gets Snippets area as custom admin views

109
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,727
So if we were to do the similar

110
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:59,263
thing with JCB

111
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,311
We could just as well

112
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Select

113
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,871
One of those

114
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,431
Obviously say dynamic

115
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,199
And select

116
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
One of those views

117
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,783
So scroll down a bit

118
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Where is it

119
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
There

120
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:16,415
The compiler we could make the compiler

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
JCB's

122
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,719
Dashboard

123
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:19,743
Now

124
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:24,607
I know it's gonna break a lot of things somehow I suppose but let's try it out

125
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
So we got JCB now we switched it to have another dashboard

126
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
Instead of the normal dashboard

127
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,567
The compile it here

128
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
And then install

129
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
Before install it I just want to tell you what I meant by things may break

130
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
We got a bunch of times here

131
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,367
And all these tabs are getting information and making it available

132
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,671
To you so you could just get

133
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
information from us

134
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,583
And we got the version here in the last build date and

135
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:00,191
Yeah so you are basically gonna remove this whole area

136
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
So or we just did

137
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
If I click on this 

138
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
install

139
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
we see first

140
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,527
It tells us that this language string is no longer here

141
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:19,391
And at first it seems like it's a broken issue but if we refreshed it

142
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
You see that actually removed it

143
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,743
And so it's just a cash thing there

144
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
So basically the dashboard is gone

145
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
And if I was to

146
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,143
Go here and click on

147
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:35,007
Component builder, it will from now on open right at the compiler

148
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:37,823
And that will now be it's default page

149
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,383
Which is what we told it

150
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,431
And so the behaviour is correct

151
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,223
We don't see any issues

152
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
And actually if you were to gonna go to the code

153
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,647
Dashboard is completely removed all is files everything

154
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:54,207
And so no trace of it is left

155
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:56,511
Obviously to undo this

156
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
you could

157
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,607
Simply say default again

158
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
And save and close

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:05,215
And then compile it again

160
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,031
And it will place the dashboard back

161
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,311
So

162
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,895
That's not really any harm done to the component

163
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,247
But for those of you wanna take the custom admin views

164
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
And design a much more

165
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,599
Impressive maybe not a boring

166
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Dashboard

167
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,671
Can now do so

168
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
By Simply using this new feature

169
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
And I'm sure it's gonna be a lot of fun

170
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,935
So there we refresh now

171
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
Are dashboards back and if you click on it

172
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,335
There we go everything is fine again

173
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,687
Shoo away thanks for watching
