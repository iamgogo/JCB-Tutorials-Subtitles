1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
The option to update a form either admin or site

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,728
View with a selected given parameters

3
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,032
So that certain fields are

4
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,336
Adapted

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,616
Just by

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,640
Click of a button

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
That takes them to the form

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Is a

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:22,784
Very valuable feature

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:26,368
And is also available in JCB

11
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,648
I'm gonna demonstrate to you

12
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,440
How to get this done

13
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
Before I do though

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
There are

15
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
2 things you need to know

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
One of them is

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,216
that there really is off the shelf

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
The option

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,568
To do this with at least one field

20
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,872
Without having to code anything

21
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
So if you have one field

22
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
Which is the list

23
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Field

24
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,272
Or

25
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,296
If it's a

26
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Text field

27
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
I think there are some limitations

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,952
What type of fields could be

29
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Targeted

30
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,488
I haven't actually

31
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:04,768
Tried them all

32
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,840
But I'm sure that if you run into

33
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:08,864
Bugs or

34
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
limitations and

35
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,192
Open a issue on GitHub

36
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
We could fix that so

37
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,264
Just let me know

38
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,664
But to demonstrate the first of the shelf easy implementive

39
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,456
Option

40
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,832
Would be to first take you to the code and show you where all is happening

41
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
OK

42
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,440
So I'm gonna compile the demo component and then just go look to

43
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
The code here

44
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:40,352
Ok so now I see the code

45
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,752
Ok so going to demo component model and opening a look model

46
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Which is the editing

47
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
View

48
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,360
of that look on the front end of this

49
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:52,360
component

50
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
We gonna scroll down to a place

51
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Called

52
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Why function

53
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
Actually

54
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
Call get form

55
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:06,720
Here it starts get form as in the get form function that a lot of things happen

56
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:10,560
Like validation the access to certain fields

57
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,120
So forth all of that is happening here

58
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,704
Because if the user doesn't have access we don't even need to you know

59
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,032
Do anything so we just dump the field right here

60
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Now

61
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:27,456
You'll see at the very end of the method there is this only load these value If no ID is found

62
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:33,344
So that means when a field is for some you know if the

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:38,464
If there is a new look being created from the front

64
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
There is no ID

65
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
So there is a

66
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,352
Value ref

67
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:50,240
And ref ID that some of you may be familiar with which basically

68
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,288
Grabs a string

69
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
From the ref

70
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
And also grabs an integer

71
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,456
And these two values are

72
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
You know things that are busy

73
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,624
Passing away we are that whole

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,928
Referral structure

75
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
We've moved

76
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,488
JCB to

77
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Instead use the return

78
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,584
Value

79
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,984
And so although this still exists all around it and it still active I would suggest that you don't use it

80
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
Because eventually I think we'll just drop it and the replacement is field and field ID

81
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:32,480
So you can actually tell JCB

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
of the bat

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,392
That this field and then that bat would basically mean a the fields name

84
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
So if the fields name is

85
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
Product or whatever

86
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
And then

87
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,632
What ID you want to have selected

88
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,680
Because this is targeting a list

89
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Field

90
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,520
So there's a list of it say products

91
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,312
In a list field

92
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
And

93
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:58,848
So

94
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,688
The result in this value should then be

95
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,480
Basically

96
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
Product like that

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,368
And result in this

98
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:12,928
Field will eventually be something like

99
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
Already this feature

100
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
to

101
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
Change the actual

102
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
Field value

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,479
I don't know does that all make sense to you

104
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:42,879
So you can already in your URL because this is this information here is taken from a

105
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
URL

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,487
You can already add a value called field

107
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,303
Which then equals the field name

108
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,119
And then add a value called field ID

109
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
Which equals the ID you want selected

110
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,495
And that it automatically

111
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
Set the value

112
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,847
Now that's only for one field

113
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:05,407
So we realized ok well

114
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,991
We may want to do this for more than one field

115
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,551
So in the interface

116
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,367
We go to admin views

117
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
And we open the look

118
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:23,071
Which is where we may want to do more we can scroll down and we'll see a place

119
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:23,839
called

120
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:26,911
Get form

121
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
So we can say

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,751
We are here

123
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
And save this

124
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,895
Where you would then be able to add more

125
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
And the so tells you that the array data that load

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
the form and the ID

127
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
Is all here the how you access those

128
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:52,767
And you can add your own implementation of what I just shown you

129
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
So let's save this and compile so we can

130
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,863
Show you where this ends up

131
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,727
So you see we are here this is where that codes ends up

132
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:05,311
So you could literally come in here grab this

133
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
And

134
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
Basically copy it in here

135
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,223
just again

136
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
Make sure you you want the ID to be there

137
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
And add your own

138
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,695
And you can decide what this must be

139
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,975
You could say

140
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
Ok

141
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,047
Whatever you like

142
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
And obviously you don't need this

143
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
And that was just because we are

144
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Actually

145
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,847
This obviously as the default so we will just make that

146
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
Null

147
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,199
And then here

148
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,503
We'll just say 0

149
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
And we changed this also to something that is generic now

150
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,975
With these values in your URL

151
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,023
You can update

152
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
This redirect

153
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
and you can change this from a string

154
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
to

155
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Or you can

156
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:11,103
Make a comma separating I mean you know how to pass values through a URL

157
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,127
And

158
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
So doing this you can

159
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
Set the stage of the form

160
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,735
With

161
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,039
Predetermined selective

162
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:23,391
Options very easily

163
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
I hope this makes sense to you

164
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
If you have any questions please leave

165
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Leave any comments in the

166
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
Video

167
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,679
comments area or go to the Forum and

168
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
Let me know

169
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,519
So that's how easy it is to

170
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Target

171
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Now

172
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Maybe

173
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,871
Just for

174
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
Making sure we are on the same page

175
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,575
This one here needs to be the field name now how how do we know what is field name

176
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
If you open the form

177
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,391
And for this

178
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:56,927
We open look

179
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,535
XML which is where the form exists it's this value name

180
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,071
so

181
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
You can

182
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
Choose this name

183
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
I would suggest that you would be careful

184
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:15,103
In what type of fields you allowed to be edited through the URL

185
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
So that

186
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,431
Yeah your form doesn't become

187
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
Hackable

188
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Somehow

189
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Exposing data it shouldn't

190
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:24,319
Or overwriting data

191
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,903
Well that there are actually catches

192
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
To validate whether a form is allowed to be

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,511
Submitted by the specific

194
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,351
User that is in place in the controller

195
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:42,751
Does do a validation so if you for example here look in the controller

196
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,311
There is allow edit

197
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
Add sorry allowadd and a allowedit

198
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,943
And it does check whether this user

199
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
This current user

200
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Has access

201
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,807
to the look area

202
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
And to this specific

203
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
ID of

204
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,767
course and then it continues to check whether it has edit

205
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:07,583
Access so all that is already in place

206
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
And so adding this

207
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
Dynamic

208
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Updating

209
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,543
Of your value in the fields shouldn't be that risky

210
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
But I still like to be careful so I would think for example

211
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
If we want to

212
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,015
Change

213
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,599
Something here let's see what field could be done

214
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
Maybe this

215
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Name field

216
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,719
So we could

217
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,511
Change that to name

218
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
So we know

219
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:42,911
That it should be name so over here

220
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,191
We could

221
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,543
Change this to field

222
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,615
Name like that

223
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
And so we could do some validation

224
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,391
If it's name then only should it actually continue

225
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:10,047
And then here because we also grabbing a string we can do some string sanitation

226
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Make sure that this is

227
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,911
A string

228
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
Capitals

229
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,591
And we also doing null here

230
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:26,431
And then we can say

231
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Field

232
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Default

233
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,831
like that

234
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
And

235
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
We can also now

236
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Validate this

237
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,607
To being a string

238
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,703
So we can grab the helper method

239
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
I mean

240
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,775
You do know that

241
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,079
Most components it has a helper

242
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:54,847
Class

243
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,223
And the helper class has a whole lot of methods that ships by Default

244
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
And

245
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
One of the very

246
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,111
Useful method that is here

247
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:11,487
besides many others is this

248
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Check string

249
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,071
Is to check

250
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
Whether is a string

251
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:19,167
Is a string and it's actually got value in it

252
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
Now you could write this out every time

253
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,263
This little

254
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,823
Validation or you could just go

255
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,615
check

256
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
String

257
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,175
Like that

258
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
And obviously the helper class

259
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,319
Like that so demo helper

260
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,927
Check string so you can validate that this string has a value

261
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,719
And then only

262
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
Use these values

263
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,071
To to update your

264
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
field

265
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,167
That you are targeting

266
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,031
And so that way you can add a value to a field

267
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
Through the URL

268
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,103
Quite easily

269
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,967
Now I could demonstrate this on the front for you for just quick 

270
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
demonstration

271
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
So very quickly have a

272
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,647
A little

273
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Look value I added one

274
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:21,887
here from the front end now we want to actually be able to create a

275
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
New one

276
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
from the front

277
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,799
So we're going to have to make a little change here

278
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,591
To the looks view

279
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
We'll have to add a

280
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,991
A link here to create or button

281
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
It says create

282
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,087
And we'll have to

283
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Do that

284
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,903
With

285
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:53,887
So here we do a can do get actions we only need to check whether it can

286
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,655
Create

287
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
We then do

288
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,495
Look create

289
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
And

290
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
Also

291
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,919
You know what let's rather use 

292
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:11,295
The user object it is on the page we don't need to actually go through all the trouble

293
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Checking the action because we not even working with

294
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
ID

295
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,695
We just wanna see if the user is allowed to

296
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:21,023
Create so we use the component name

297
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
And this

298
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
View

299
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
Look

300
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,399
Is the one where we gonna be creating see

301
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,679
it's there

302
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,287
So use that as the area to validate that create a look

303
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
And then we create our little button

304
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,943
And we we're using some

305
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:39,711
Uikit

306
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,295
Classes up here for our button you could obviously do your own thing

307
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
And if it can't create then just no string

308
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,415
Just a empty string

309
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,695
And then in the

310
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,815
Default View area we basically gonna just Echo the create link

311
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Ok so this is just to get a create button on the page we haven't come to the field thing yet

312
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
we will do that in a moment

313
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,591
Let's just show you the button on the page

314
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,247
Ok so know having compiled and installed there is now create look

315
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,319
The pencil is not that ideal

316
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
you should change it to something else

317
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:22,719
So if you click on it it actually gives you the option to create a look

318
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
There we go

319
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
And

320
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,071
This is what we expect

321
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,887
Now what we wanna do is we wanna add a value

322
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,423
To this field here

323
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,703
By Default

324
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,751
So that if I click on that link

325
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,847
Automatic adds a value that's just a demonstration

326
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,431
We could do that with any text field and any list field

327
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,087
So going back to the admin view we gonna make sure we got everything set up right for for this catch

328
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,671
So in the get fom method

329
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:59,071
We now have a validation here to make sure it's a new item then we gotta use this

330
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
yhy

331
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Just The generic we can

332
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,167
Anything

333
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,007
And we know that must be just a word no string there

334
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Then we gonna do yhy value and this is gonna be a string and

335
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
And we gonna check this string like we said we doing

336
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
And we gonna check that the field name

337
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
Is not null

338
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,111
And then only

339
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:24,671
We gonna update that value

340
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
So we can just say now set

341
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
Field default value

342
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
Ok so

343
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,887
We gonna save this and

344
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
compile

345
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:39,007
And then run a few tests

346
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:45,407
Ok I've installed it so I'm gonna add now without adding it to the link just as a demonstration in the URL

347
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
I'm gonna type

348
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,503
Some value

349
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,295
And press enter

350
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:56,927
And now we see it loads up with that New value in place and

351
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,487
So it works

352
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,535
So we set the

353
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,583
y and y to name

354
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
And this value to James

355
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:10,495
If we left it empty like that and clicked

356
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,311
It'll just be empty so

357
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:15,615
It is giving us the expected result

358
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
Now we can go back to our site View

359
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,735
Where we have our link

360
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,039
And we can decide

361
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Maybe

362
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,855
The user has a name

363
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:30,719
We want to add that name automatically if it Clicks the link

364
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,023
So let's do that

365
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,887
So we've added the field is name

366
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:39,679
The value will be based on the

367
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,703
Username

368
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
Or actually the name

369
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,311
And if there is none set it will just return empty

370
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
String

371
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,615
And so

372
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
we've got that setup

373
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Let's save this and install

374
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
So now if I go over the button and I look here at the bottom of the screen it actually shows my name in there

375
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
do you see it

376
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Now if I click the button

377
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:03,487
Now I ran into a little trouble here

378
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:07,327
And we'll have to maybe look at this

379
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,959
But if you remember I actually The Way We Built This URL in the backend

380
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
We passed it through a task

381
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:20,383
We didn't actually use this URL

382
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,199
We actually use the view look

383
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
And then task look edit

384
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
And that's how we

385
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,903
We passed it then this is because then we will have a well

386
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:38,047
A redirecting validation right here but doing that it was dumping

387
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,351
These values and it wasn't passing it

388
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,375
Through to the form

389
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
I went and then adapted this URL to actually use this URL

390
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,407
Instead so basically did this copy that

391
00:17:54,431 --> 00:18:00,575
Come back here and just updated our URL like that

392
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,183
And it still worked and now it was passing the values through

393
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:06,719
Now

394
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:13,119
I'll need to test this a little more to be absolutely sure that this is not gonna cause some other

395
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
Headaches

396
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:21,567
But that is working I'm locked in in the backend at the moment of this

397
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
or in the front end

398
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
At the moment

399
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,455
As an administrator

400
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:33,855
So I'll have to login as a lesser permission individual and see how it behaves

401
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,879
then

402
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,927
But if we click look now

403
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:41,535
It passes the value right to the field like we've been anticipated

404
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,375
Based on these parameters that we've added

405
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:47,167
And it doesn't remove them

406
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,727
So this is what you would want

407
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
And this is working

408
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
I'm just not sure how this will relate down to those with less permission on the system

409
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:05,087
And this tutorial is getting too long to actually spend time on that now

410
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
So you'll have to play around with this if you run into something that's quite obviously a problem

411
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,071
Please let me know.  Well, thanks for watching.
