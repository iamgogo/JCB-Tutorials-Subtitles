00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:05,376
Hi welcome to Joomla component Builder

2
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:08,704
Hello world tutorial

3
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:12,032
It's been asked that we give you

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,128
Some guidelines or quick instruction

5
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:20,992
On how to go from Zero to Hero

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,112
Obviously there is a hello world and then there is a hello world

7
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
Let me explain

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,024
When we go to Joomla's

9
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,912
Repository on GitHub they have a Hello world component here

10
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,960
And

11
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:46,592
It has a few files obviously it's been done quite some time ago

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,688
And

13
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,504
Even if you open these files

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,576
They really not populated with data

15
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,440
And So all it really does is it shows you

16
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:08,096
The very bare essentials of what's required to make an component work in Joomla

17
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:12,192
Now we obviously gonna do

18
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:16,544
Way much more than this I mean the

19
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
The reality is

20
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,408
This code here is hardly non-existent

21
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,040
When we are done we'll have an application with quite a lot of

22
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
Lines written

23
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720
And quite a lot of structures added which it goes way beyond just a

24
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
Bare bone framework

25
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:42,144
So keep that in mind we're doing a Hello world component

26
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
But when we've done

27
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
It will actually be

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,592
Much more than just a wire frame component

29
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:55,200
So you can go over to GitHub

30
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,784
Forward slash VDM - IO

31
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,904
Fordward slash Joomla - component - Builder

32
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,744
And download the latest release

33
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,792
Just go to releases

34
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
And

35
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,144
Then download

36
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
Or copy the link

37
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
Do this JCB file

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Then in a blank Joomla website

39
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:24,384
I'm gonna install this

40
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:26,176
File

41
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,968
And

42
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,040
Build This hello world component

43
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,112
There we go

44
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
We have the component installed

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,208
We can now open it

46
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Component Builder

47
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,328
Is ready to start

48
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
First thing we'll do is we'll create a field

49
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:55,360
There are Fields But just that you can see just We're creating a simple basic custom text field

50
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
Field

51
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
And we're just gonna call it

52
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
greeting

53
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
We're gonna give it a name

54
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,648
Greeting

55
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
Now as you

56
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,720
will see is

57
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:16,096
It already had a lot of demo material here

58
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:20,704
I'm not gonna change any of that I'm just gonna remove a few things which

59
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,520
I know it's necessary

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,360
And actually

61
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,944
The field will work even though

62
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,272
These lines are removed

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
So

64
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
I think we'll do that and

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,720
Well here say

66
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,096
greeting

67
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Ok

68
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:10,368
I think that should be enough we gonna change this to

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
Varchar

70
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,976
I think that's also good enough

71
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,303
And basically save and close

72
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
So there is our new field

73
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
Next thing to do

74
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:26,495
Is great in admin view

75
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,175
The admin view is really what links

76
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,223
Your Fields to the Database

77
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,063
So we gonna call it greeting

78
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,903
For single record and greetings for

79
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:47,231
a list of records and

80
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Greetings

81
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
Just for a sister name

82
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
So that we can identify this

83
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:05,151
Across the system and I'm gonna add their greetings

84
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,527
We gonna add a few generic icons here

85
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,111
Then we're gonna link that field we made

86
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,487
You want it obviously to show

87
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:25,119
to be the first one act as a title be sort of all searchable

88
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,703
And be a link in the first tab

89
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
And first in that tab

90
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,359
And give it permissions

91
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
And save

92
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
The rest of the

93
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,783
The structure could be left as is

94
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
And actually

95
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
We will have a working component

96
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,183
With this as an admin View

97
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
So save and close

98
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
Now we need to create the component

99
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,727
So I clicked on new

100
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,775
and loads a

101
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,079
Add new Joomla component

102
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,199
I'm gonna call it Hello world

103
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,023
For the most part I'm just

104
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
Adding

105
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
It's some dummy data here

106
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,423
Can I select an icon

107
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,727
make the image which

108
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:40,127
Will be shown after installation of the component as well as in the back of the component

109
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,711
Ok so we have that set

110
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
The rest of the features

111
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,415
Besides in the settings we need to link the admin view for now

112
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,999
so just select greetings

113
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:02,655
One of the main menu want to add yes submenu autocheck in history

114
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
Has metadata

115
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,263
has access

116
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,311
allow Import export

117
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,079
And

118
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
This is important

119
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,271
Add a create site view so on the front end it will already create for us

120
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,623
The editing view it will not create a listview

121
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,439
Only to edit and create

122
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,815
Greetings on the front and we obviously want this to be the first

123
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
So

124
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,935
There we've linked our admin view and we click save

125
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,727
Save and close

126
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,079
Now we actually have our component set

127
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,175
Let's compile it there is obviously

128
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,503
Not a very workable front-end yet

129
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,039
So

130
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,135
I'm just gonna compile this and install it onto this Joomla install

131
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:58,207
We don't need that

132
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Just select

133
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,535
Hello world

134
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Also don't need that

135
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
And then compile

136
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,055
So just like that we have 8000 lines written

137
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,639
Spelled 160 pages A4 book

138
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
So

139
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,831
That's way more than the hello world component we just looked at

140
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,671
Now if we open the back end

141
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,791
Oh we haven't installed it. You could install it via the

142
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,375
Normal installer in fact let's

143
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,703
Let's see if we can get that going

144
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:42,239
So

145
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:44,799
I've pasted the URL here

146
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,383
That we find on this page here

147
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
And we'll click

148
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,479
Check and install

149
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,623
Ok so we have the Hello world component installed

150
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,951
We can open here and go to Hello world

151
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
And there's the component

152
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
We can go to the list and

153
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
This is where a list of greetings will show

154
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,167
Click new

155
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
And we can

156
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,775
add some text say hi there

157
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
James

158
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Save and Close

159
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
And there is our first greeting

160
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:25,247
We can open it again

161
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,391
And there it is it has a publishing structure that has permissions

162
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,439
It has version control

163
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
So if we change this

164
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,559
To hi there Michael

165
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
and save and close

166
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,423
It will actually update we can open it

167
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,823
And if you go versions you see that all of that is working you can open the previous version

168
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
You can see it was James you can see who changed it

169
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:57,247
All of that was done in those few Clicks

170
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:03,135
I think that's worth noticing and in just a few Clicks we have a whole workable

171
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
Component

172
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,511
Which is installed now let's go look at the code just quickly

173
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:13,631
So here's the installer script of the Hello component

174
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
And

175
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
It actually

176
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:22,079
Adds the whole component into the content types and

177
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
Into all the relevant areas

178
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,247
It does a check to see that we're at least at Joomla 3.6

179
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,527
And

180
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
It also

181
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Has created

182
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,415
The greeting table

183
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Modules

184
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:42,559
It has created helper structures

185
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,143
There is a

186
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,495
Helper class been setup

187
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:56,895
Which has many features of functions methods

188
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,991
Wish you can come and browse through the helper class and

189
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
you know

190
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
If you know PHP you'll

191
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:09,951
See that this is a very helpful method just grabbing one value from the database and

192
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
So there are many functions in here which you can now use around your component

193
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
by simply calling the helper class

194
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,495
Ok so that's just quickly looking at the fact that

195
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:27,103
This all of this was built I remember when we looked at

196
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
the other

197
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,431
Hello world component

198
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:34,271
This is really all that there is in the app and area

199
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,879
Is a sequel folder with a few sequel files

200
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:44,511
1 php file and that's about it

201
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:49,119
Now I give you yes this is a wireframe but

202
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,191
JCB has built

203
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
a

204
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,239
Very

205
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
More

206
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Populated

207
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:04,479
Hello world in a very short time and you can look through this back end

208
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:10,879
Folder and see the structure and exactly how you know you need to have the components structure

209
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
done

210
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439
Ok so now

211
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:19,839
For the next part of the tutorial we will focus on adding a front end to this component

212
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,167
And you must remember that

213
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,215
We left the front end

214
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
Open ended really

215
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,615
Because we want to allow developers to

216
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:36,735
Actually be able to express themselves in unique ways

217
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:41,599
And not have a cookie cutter recipe you know that just

218
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Gets used over and over

219
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
But that there could be such diversity and difference between components that are

220
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:56,191
Built with JCB that only the back end really look similar but the front end can always look

221
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:00,799
Completely different from anything else so to avoid you know

222
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
It always looking the same and that means a lot of custom coding is needed for the front end

223
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,855
And you need to know quite a bit of PHP and even how Joomla works to make this

224
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,159
work so I'm just gonna give you

225
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:22,559
The quickest shortest path to getting a front end which firstly can display

226
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,143
the items and secondly can

227
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Edit them

228
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,471
So

229
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Let's get started

230
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:35,615
First thing to build when we are setting up the front end

231
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
Would be a dynamic Git

232
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,735
Dynamic Git is

233
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
JCB's way

234
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
Of giving you

235
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
An easy way to

236
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:52,767
Grab various tables in combined datasets

237
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,839
And deliver them to the front end of any

238
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
Site View

239
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,215
You can reuse them

240
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
You can even add multiple ones of them

241
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:10,687
I'm not gonna go into those details I'm just gonna build a very simple one so let's get

242
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,223
Started with that first

243
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,391
I'm going to call it greeting list and I'm gonna make sure this is a list query

244
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
And I'm gonna

245
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,999
Link it to a

246
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Back end view

247
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,887
Greetings I'm just gonna have it grab all the data

248
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
I'm going to say no I don't want  pignation

249
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:35,519
And I'm gonna just have one

250
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Where filter

251
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,871
Basically

252
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Gonna take published here

253
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
Copy that

254
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:47,039
And put it in here and say

255
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
When published

256
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
Equals 1

257
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
Just grab published items and nothing else

258
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,999
And there we go

259
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:57,023
We grabbing

260
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,839
All the data from this one table

261
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:04,703
And we are putting it on the front just filtering it with this where

262
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,311
Option now like I said you can join other tables

263
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
On relation with this data

264
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,943
But I'm not gonna go into depth

265
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,735
Just quickly and brief

266
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:17,503
Here we go

267
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,295
Greeting list is done

268
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,135
So there's our greeting list

269
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Now we want to have

270
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:26,975
Another

271
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,303
Dynamic Git just to view One greeting

272
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
So let's create that

273
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:41,567
I'm gonna call it greeting leave it as a Git item

274
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,847
Again

275
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
use a back end View

276
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,711
And then select greeting

277
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,783
And this time I'm gonna use filter

278
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,391
And just add here ID and

279
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,951
A dot i d

280
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,279
So that should do it save

281
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
And save and close

282
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:08,191
So now we have our two Dynamic Gits in place

283
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,263
Second step Side views

284
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
So we'll create firstly a site view for the lists of items

285
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,711
We'll select

286
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:23,551
The get query for the list

287
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:30,463
If we wanna see how it possibly would look I mean the PHP we have a

288
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
snippet

289
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
You can select the same

290
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:40,703
Option and it'll give you a suggestive idea of how the PHP may look

291
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,239
This May differ

292
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:45,567
Depending on how you set up your

293
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
Dynamic get

294
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
But in reality most of the time it is correct and you can simply copy paste some of the

295
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
Snippets write into your code here

296
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:57,599
And

297
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,975
Immediately start using it so I'm just gonna

298
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Add a little

299
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,559
unordered list here

300
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:09,375
So we will have a list item basically

301
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,191
And we'll just

302
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Echo

303
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,127
Greeting as a text

304
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
And

305
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,247
Then

306
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,039
Grap that

307
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Snippet

308
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,855
Paste that in there

309
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Close the unordered list

310
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,207
Now we wanna

311
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,791
Use little nice unordered list here

312
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
So we gonna grab this

313
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
As this opening tag

314
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,543
And then

315
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
Close it

316
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,687
And we gonna call this

317
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
greeting

318
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,343
Greetings I think will be best

319
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
And greetings

320
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,719
Again

321
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Greetings

322
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
Initial description

323
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,679
Ok so we're all set here

324
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
And

325
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:21,311
For now as you see there is no links here

326
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,407
We haven't we will actually have to come back and add some links

327
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,199
For now I'm just adding

328
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
An iteration over there

329
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
The items and displaying the greetings

330
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,879
So we're gonna save and close out of this

331
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
And now we gonna create one

332
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
Where we only look at 1

333
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,791
Greeting

334
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,119
So again we'll just select

335
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
That one greeting

336
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,959
Git method

337
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:52,287
And here as well and we see that the greeting

338
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
Possibly look like that

339
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:56,639
So we'll echo it out

340
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
And

341
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
we're gonna make it

342
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,247
an H2

343
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,831
Header tag

344
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
And then

345
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,415
We can't call it greeting

346
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
Because

347
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
We have an editing

348
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,815
View

349
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,887
That will be dynamically added to the front

350
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:22,751
Now because the editing view on the back is called greeting

351
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,079
We cannot call another front end

352
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:29,663
View

353
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,759
A greeting we have to call it something else otherwise it will conflict

354
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:35,807
So I'm just gonna call it

355
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,087
Greet

356
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,903
For now

357
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,255
We can call it here we could call it greeting but here we'll call it greet

358
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,047
And then

359
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
greeting and

360
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,935
Greeting on top here as well

361
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:58,591
So here we go we've got all the necessary components lined up for this

362
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
specific site view

363
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
To function as expected

364
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,199
So save and close

365
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
So now we have our two site views set

366
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:11,903
I'm gonna now go to the component to add them to the component

367
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
So again we go to settings

368
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,303
And we go to site views

369
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,863
And we will add

370
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,143
greeting

371
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,447
It doesn't have a menu

372
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
It has metadata it's not the default view

373
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,615
We can

374
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,943
Add access and then make the default public

375
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:39,039
The second one is greetings

376
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:41,599
This must have a menu

377
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,647
Also metadata

378
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
This is the default View

379
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,487
We can also

380
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,023
Give it access

381
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,583
And make it by Default public

382
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:55,935
There we go we got out two site views save and close

383
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Save and close

384
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,311
So we go to the compiler

385
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:06,431
And we compile the Hello world component

386
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:09,759
For the second time

387
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,087
And then once compiled

388
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,720
You now see that we got nearly 13000 lines of code

389
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
And we can now

390
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:27,424
Just click here to install which is the easy way instead of going to the installer

391
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Now if we go back to the code

392
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,312
And we scroll down

393
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,896
We'll see that there is now a component

394
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,944
in the front end called hello world

395
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:44,576
And it has the model's greet greeting and greetings

396
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:51,488
It has the views greet greeting and greetings this one is an edit View

397
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,512
This greeting

398
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:56,352
And this one is a display view this one

399
00:21:56,608 --> 00:22:02,752
Is it where you can look at how it is getting the values from the database so that

400
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,288
Dynamic Get

401
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
It built

402
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,896
Basically this function for us

403
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,480
As well as parts inside of this function here

404
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Now

405
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,088
You see that it added that little

406
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
Where filter for us

407
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
And

408
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,744
All the values are here as expected

409
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
Here it's having that permission check

410
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:32,960
So it is gonna check whether you have the correct permissions

411
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,800
Now because we have not

412
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,360
You know installed the component

413
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:45,760
As a blank component we installed it and then made changes install it again it will not be by

414
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
Default be set public

415
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,696
The way that it sets the view public

416
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,976
Is during

417
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,256
Post flight

418
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,792
Install

419
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,608
It actually

420
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Set a rule

421
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:08,800
And adds the side greeting access to public which usually is the ID Group 1

422
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:12,384
And then it updates the asset table

423
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,432
And since

424
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
This isn't a new install

425
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,528
It actually doesn't do that

426
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,440
And so you won't have the expected result of the view being public simply because the component

427
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,720
Wasn't installed

428
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:33,376
As fresh so how to demonstrate to you how it will behave if a user install

429
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:36,448
This the first time fully

430
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,752
you know

431
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:43,616
Compiled as it is now I'll just simply uninstall a component quickly

432
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,688
And install it again

433
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,784
Which will then activate this feature

434
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:55,904
Now some you may not understand all I've just said that's ok

435
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,696
I would just suggest that

436
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,792
As you've developed the moment you add the front

437
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,608
Side views to the component

438
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,472
And you have actually tweaked its access and all those

439
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,776
Related parameters

440
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:18,176
It might be best to just uninstall the component and install it completely Fresh

441
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:21,760
To see the fool behaviour working as expected

442
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:28,416
you might say but I already created some demo data and now I need to put them punch them

443
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,048
Back in again well there is a way to sort of resolve that

444
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,424
And that is going to the admin View opening the greeting

445
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,640
Going to the MySQL tab

446
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,176
Select yes

447
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
Select Table

448
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
And then

449
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:55,296
Click add to select the table

450
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:00,160
Then scroll down to that specific table in your database

451
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
It should be

452
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
hello world

453
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,328
Greeting

454
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:12,704
Then you'll see it loads the specific values from the database

455
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,776
And how they will be named in your

456
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:22,176
Backup I usually remove this created by modified by because it

457
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
May cause conflicts if user ID is changed from one Joomla install to another

458
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:33,184
And I also sometimes remove

459
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,976
The access

460
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,256
Value

461
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,840
As this may also differ from system to system

462
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,400
And the acid ID

463
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:47,520
So I'm only exporting values which I think are consistent across

464
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Systems

465
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,824
Ok

466
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,128
Obviously

467
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,176
This one is well

468
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,480
And this one

469
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,296
okay safe

470
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,856
Now save and close

471
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:05,952
Now this isn't enough just having have mapped the

472
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:12,608
Sequel table if you wanna retain the data now what what date am I talking about

473
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:17,472
well we installed it right and so if we open the component

474
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,752
We added

475
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:25,152
This greeting so the retained this greeting if you've created quite a few

476
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,552
Dummy greetings then to retain them so that they get installed again

477
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:37,952
Even if it's a fresh install that's the way you do that but you have to compile it

478
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,560
The component you have to compile the component before you uninstall it

479
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,656
Otherwise it will shout at you and say that it couldn't find the database

480
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,728
Because you obviously gonna remove it when you uninstall it

481
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,288
So I'm just gonna compile this again

482
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:55,616
And then after it been compiled

483
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,200
I'm gonna uninstall it as I said I would

484
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:04,064
So you're in the extension manager I'm gonna click

485
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
On the hello world

486
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,160
And uninstall

487
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
And it would have successfully uninstalled it

488
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,352
Then I'm gonna go back to the compiler page

489
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:19,936
and just click on the install

490
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,264
And then if I go back to the component

491
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,336
I see that it's added that greeting back in

492
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:29,664
And I haven't lost a beat ok

493
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,992
Now let's look at the front end

494
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
By linking it to a menu item

495
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:40,416
So have greeting selected as the menu item type

496
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,512
And I'm gonna just make this the the default page

497
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:48,096
The home page and save and close

498
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,424
Now I'm gonna open the homepage

499
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,752
There we see our greeting it says greeting

500
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
Hi there Michael

501
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,616
So it's actually worked as expected

502
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:05,504
Let's just add another one to see it how it will look when we have more than one greeting

503
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:23,168
Ok I think now we have enough

504
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
If we go back to the front end

505
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:28,288
And refresh

506
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:35,712
There we go there's our greetings now to make them clickable and editable

507
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:41,088
Let's do the opening it and just viewing it first

508
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:45,696
So in the site view area I'm gonna open greetings

509
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,000
Now around

510
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,280
This

511
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:53,888
Greeting Echo I'm gonna add an H ref

512
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
And a link we gonna build a link using some of the helper methods and

513
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,104
And also what is called The Slug

514
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:08,992
The Slug wouldn't necessarily this time function because we didn't add an alias to our table

515
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:15,392
But when there is an alias the slug will dynamically be used within search engine friendly URLs

516
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,768
I'm not gonna demonstrate or explain too much about this

517
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
But

518
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:25,632
I'm gonna just quickly at the link in here

519
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,424
Now I know

520
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:30,752
You may be wondering where is this

521
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:36,128
Items slug come from It's not showing here on the side

522
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
Well

523
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,528
Like with most of these developing components

524
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:46,624
You need to know a little bit about how

525
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,000
To read code and understand code and that's why you would compile the code

526
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:58,656
And then actually go look at the compiled code in your IDE so if you were to open the

527
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,680
Model

528
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,960
Which

529
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,264
Is using this Dynamic Git

530
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:06,336
You'll see that it actually builds a slug in the model

531
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,920
So here in the model here's the get items

532
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,296
So it's looping through them here and then it's checking with it as an alias

533
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:19,904
And then ID and if they are there sure then

534
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
It actually

535
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,232
Combines them with this

536
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
And

537
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:29,632
Creates a slug otherwise it just plays as the ID in The Slug

538
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
And

539
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:36,288
That's how you would know that the Slug is already created and you can just use it

540
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:39,104
And so it's always good to

541
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,432
While you're developing a component with JCB

542
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:48,832
Go into the code read the code look at what it's done and it'll help you see and understand

543
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
And how to extend it

544
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:55,232
We trying to follow the normal way of how

545
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,608
Joomla's able to you know develop and be used so

546
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,888
That you can

547
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:06,240
Easily follow along and that it wouldn't get

548
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:12,640
we're not trying to reinvent with the wheel but doing things the way that you would expect if you know

549
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
How to build Joomla components

550
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,736
you know by hand

551
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,528
Ok so

552
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Now we created that link

553
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:23,904
You basically used j route which is a

554
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:27,488
A common class in building routes in

555
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:33,120
Joomla here is the helper out class you can look that up

556
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
It is in the

557
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:41,056
Site area of the component under the helper folder and it has a function called

558
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,336
Greed route

559
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:47,712
And we just passing it The Slug and that will crank out the whole URL for us

560
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,272
And so we gonna save and close here

561
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:52,064
I just save for now

562
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,160
Now we gonna just compile it again

563
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
and Install it back in

564
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:04,608
since we haven't made any changes to permissions or any of those things now the permissions just

565
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
A short

566
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
tip on that again it is only when the related to the site views that we need to maybe just reinstall

567
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544


568
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:19,200
The whole component do keep in mind that you could go into the backend and set the permissions

569
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:25,600
If that is what you would prefer so in the back end you can just go to options the back end

570
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Of the component I mean

571
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,928
And there's the permission tab

572
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
And you can see this is a whole list of permissions just for the greetings and because we install

573
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,728
The component afresh it's set the greeting site view access to public

574
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:48,128
As well as the greetings site view access to public so that's really what we did

575
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:48,896
We just

576
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,760
had that done automatically but you could have come in here and just change that to allowed

577
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:57,344
And save and it will have achieved the same thing

578
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,208
You'll see that there is a whole lot of features here in allowing

579
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,816
You to edit certain parts of the values for specific groups

580
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
And so all of this

581
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:10,656
JCB is just placed

582
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:13,472
you know for you and ready to use

583
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,080
Now did we have installed the component let's refresh this homepage

584
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,408
and we will see that all of these links are now clickable

585
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,480
If we click on one of them

586
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,808
We see it only displays that specific

587
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,624
Greeting you can click back

588
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:33,440
And then click another one and it

589
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,584
And so it's working as expected it's generating for us the links and it is

590
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,888
Actually opening that View

591
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
And displaying the value as expected

592
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,776
Now to add an edit button

593
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,616
Which can then edit these

594
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,920
Items on the front end of the site

595
00:33:54,688 --> 00:34:00,832
I would mind you noticed we just crossed the half an hour barrier so everything we've done now

596
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:07,232
Taking you half an hour to build a hello world component which is far more advanced and superior than

597
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,072
Any other Hello world component I've seen

598
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,120
And so

599
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
I think even just if we were to end here JCB is already proven to you that

600
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,848
It is actually able to build

601
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,872
Very

602
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:30,272
Dynamic and powerful components in a very quick and short amount of time

603
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,064
But now just to

604
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:38,976
Push the boundaries even little further let's link the editing options in for this

605
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:40,000
Items

606
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,352
Now you might want to have permission or checks here

607
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
When

608
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:50,752
The user isn't in the correct group that it wouldn't display the edit

609
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:53,312
item sorry the edit link

610
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,592
Now

611
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:59,968
If you do not know how to do that just a little heads up I can show you where to look

612
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:06,624
so in the back end again going into the code we open the Hello world component

613
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,184
We go into views

614
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,256
then into greetings

615
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:16,608
And then we open this view HTML dot php file

616
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,936
you will see that we are pulling a

617
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
Helper class here

618
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,568
And using the Git actions method

619
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:31,968
we're passing greeting to it as saying we want the permissions for the

620
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,248
Greeting

621
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,576
Now that delivers to us a

622
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,672
An object which we then can ask

623
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:43,232
Whether the user has edit rights

624
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,144
Whether the user can create delete whether he can say the state and so

625
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
That is how we can get

626
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,472
You know

627
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,568
Into the permissions you can look at this

628
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,104
Git actions

629
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,760
Method in the front you'd basically go to hello World helpers and

630
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,784
Open the

631
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,576
Helper class

632
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,880
And scroll down a little

633
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
And you'll get

634
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,072
The Git actions method is right here

635
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:25,472
So you're passing it the views name you could even pass it the record ID because we know

636
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,824
That you could set permissions not only per view but even per item

637
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
And so

638
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,432
Then this helps you

639
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:41,088
Actually determine the permissions and sends back the results now

640
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
We're always open to improving this this is what I've done so far in in

641
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:53,120
Helping us getting a quick answer on permissions from anywhere in the component

642
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:59,520
And so you could make use of this to determine some of the permissions for actually

643
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:01,312
Being able to edit the items

644
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,848
Yet

645
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,944
Even if you left out Those if you just dumped the button right on the page

646
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:14,112
The controller actually has a lot of these permissions already in place and

647
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:20,256
So it'll shout at you and tell you, you don't have permissions to edit this item and so that's what I'll demonstrate

648
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,816
So I'm just gonna add a little

649
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:25,120
Link here

650
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,168
To actually edit

651
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
The the item

652
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:35,360
Now again you might not know what that link should be

653
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:39,200
And you could go back to the back end of the component

654
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:41,504
To find the link

655
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,552
So here in the back end

656
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:49,952
I'm just simply opening the templates view and then I'm opening

657
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,256
The body

658
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,424
File and then here it has the link obviously it's in the back end it

659
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,568
Actually is related to the admin folder but in the front end it is related to the site's root

660
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,128
So you could just grab this

661
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,176
Snippet here

662
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
To build your link

663
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,760
Scroll down a little in the page

664
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,832
And basically search for this variable

665
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:22,464
And you'll see that we're using that edit variable

666
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,584
Adding and ID = and then just adding the ID

667
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:30,400
That's how we're building the link in the backend

668
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,704
And you could do similar in the front

669
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:38,848
The add some custom PHP to the front of the site there is a

670
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,640
PHP tab

671
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:42,176
And

672
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:49,088
Custom view script and it says here add custom PHP script to the head of the file so I'm just gonna

673
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:50,624
Paste that in there

674
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Basically

675
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,232
We now have an edit variable on the page

676
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,072
And so in the default View area

677
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:03,680
I'm just gonna Echo that edit and then again to the add ID

678
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,472
Echo ID

679
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,520
Around the edit

680
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Link

681
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:11,360
And how just click save

682
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,176
And then compile

683
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
This component again and install

684
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,208
And now go to the home page and refresh

685
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:30,048
Now we see there is a new edit link here

686
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,352
If we click it now

687
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:38,752
It's gonna shout at us and say no you don't have permit you're not permitted to edit this item so

688
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:41,824
I'm just gonna log in here as a user

689
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,384
That will have permissions

690
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,248
Ok I'm not logged in I'm gonna click on this edit link again

691
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
And as you can see it's opened and edit view where I can see the publish conserves the permissions

692
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:57,952
And

693
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
I can change

694
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
William

695
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,352
to Joomla and save and close

696
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,192
And it's edited that value

697
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:11,008
And that's it we have

698
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,336
Demonstrated the build of a hello world component

699
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,616
From scratch

700
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,664
And in just a few Clicks

701
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:24,576
We have successfully set up a component with tremendous advanced features already

702
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
At its fingertips

703
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,648
Ready to go

704
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,768
Well I hope this will be helpful to many if you're out there and

705
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Enjoy
