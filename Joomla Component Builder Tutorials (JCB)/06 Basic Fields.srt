1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Ok we are looking at creating Fields there are two groups I would call

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,680
Call them

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,960
Easy or

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Plain or

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,264
Common

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
Field types

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,104
Which we will be looking at first

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,224
There are also advanced field types which primarily is your custom field types

9
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:26,112
Which we'll only look at after we have covered the admin views and how you connect

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
Fields to views

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:32,000
It's quite important because those custom field types

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,608
Really only makes sense if you see the relationship between views and fields

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
And if you've already have that knowledge

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,472
Well

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,544
Well acquainted and able to handle

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,152
Ok so we'll First look at the most more common field types

17
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:53,760
Not all of them of course I'm just gonna illustrate to you the text field type

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
And a list field type

19
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:01,952
And all the other sort of follow the same kind of implementation

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,768
So let's create a new field type

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,144
We would select

22
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Text

23
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
As our first illustration

24
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:18,336
and it will automatically load

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,712
The fields here set on the field types default settings we looked at previously

26
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
When it comes to this information here

27
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,344
You need to have a well

28
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
Formulated background formulate is not right word there

29
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
Well a good background

30
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
On

31
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
MySQL

32
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,008
To understand exactly the What is a varchar

33
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,848
What is what is a text what is a medium text long text

34
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
these are basically the data type

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,968
In relation to the database

36
00:01:56,480 --> 00:02:00,576
Now I've added the feature of you being able to change that

37
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,160
Because I want to liberate your ability to develop

38
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,464
Applications that are more advanced

39
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,232
Than

40
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,048
A cookie cutter kind of component Builder

41
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
So this component builder really wants to leave

42
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Enough room

43
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:16,192
For you too

44
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
Make

45
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,752
Very advanced choices

46
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
And the more I constrain it

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,896
To a sort of just click here there

48
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,968
Don't know any code just go on and build something

49
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
The more I am gonna frustrate the real developer who is wanting to design something more advanced

50
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
More versatile

51
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,816
So I didn't choose that option there are component Builders out there that most possibly have done

52
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Done that

53
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,632
But I don't want to

54
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,032
I wanna give you enough tools to really be creative and so that means a little bit

55
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,592
More complexity all over

56
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Because of that

57
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
But if you know PHP and you have worked

58
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:01,760
with PHP in relation to sequel

59
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,344
Or any other sequel database connections via

60
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:08,672
Java or any other language

61
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
You will know that there is such a thing as a data type and that it has a length

62
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,864
And it you can

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Set some default value to it

64
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:25,568
And you can decide whether it's a key or a unique key just realise if you set it as a unique key as a

65
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
Index type then that means that specific field will only allow a value once

66
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,344
And if that same value is placed in it it will you know shout at you and it will be an error

67
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
So

68
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,160
You hardly ever use that

69
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:44,256
Not even for an alias will you use that because the alias

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:49,120
Implementation in Joomla deals with the duplication within the model

71
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
When it saves the information

72
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:57,568
It actually checks whether there is an alias in the database and implements the alias so that it doesn't

73
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Conflict

74
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,432
so even there you do not even need the

75
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
That feature

76
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:08,832
But it is available and you might see a need to use it so I added it there so you can choose it

77
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,208
And then your normal null switch whether the table should be null if it's empty

78
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:16,000
Usually

79
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,024
you would use

80
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:21,631
One of these default values and then set it not null

81
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
Ok and then

82
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,799
The story method you will most of the time use default

83
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,639
This being because these other methods

84
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:35,199
require much more knowledge

85
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
Of what you are trying to achieve

86
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,295
And if you do have that knowledge

87
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
Then I could say that JSON

88
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,927
Will mostly be used

89
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
When

90
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
You are storing

91
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,279
An array of items

92
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,559
To the database

93
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:51,583
And yet

94
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
When you are using list which we'll look at just now you wouldn't need to use JSON because Joomla's

95
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
implementation of the list field type

96
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,079
Deals with arrays already

97
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
Unless you are using sorry I'm not saying that correctly

98
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
If the list

99
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,855
Allows for multiple selection

100
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Then you need to use JSON

101
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,791
But as far as I can remember I think let me just check here to be sure

102
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:23,327
I'm in the code

103
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:29,471
And here is the place where we sort of deal with you know how are we gonna store the data

104
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,799
Or we basically tripping the switches for it

105
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:35,103
And let me just look

106
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
Down here

107
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
Ok

108
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
So

109
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
If the field type is checkboxes

110
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,551
It will

111
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,319
It will

112
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,599
Going here

113
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,879
And it will add it

114
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,159
Is it JSON

115
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,695
Object

116
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,767
If there is multiple selected

117
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,327
It will add it as a JSON option object

118
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:56,863
If

119
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
The type name is tag

120
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,215
so if you using a tag field type

121
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:04,799
It will not go in here no matter what you do

122
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,127
Let me see

123
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,407
Store

124
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,503
If it's not zero which is default

125
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
Then it will fall back onto this

126
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,159
Now if it is check box and you haven't selected

127
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,719
One of those

128
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
Features

129
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,023
For example

130
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,351
If you haven't selected one of these

131
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
JSON

132
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
base64

133
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,031
And it is a checkbox

134
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
Field type

135
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,359
Then

136
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
It will fall back

137
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455


138
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,319
To JSON

139
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
So that's the default switch

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,719
So in the switch it takes what you've set

141
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:59,583
If you set it to JSON it will use JSON if you set it to base it will use base

142
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
if you've done an encryption it will use that

143
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,983
But if you've set none and it is a checkbox

144
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
it will set it

145
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
To JSON so

146
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Even if you set

147
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,127
The checkbox to default

148
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:18,271
We are still gonna make sure it's safe as JSON because Joomla doesn't deal with checkboxes correctly

149
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,367
In fact it tells you that has a warning on their pages

150
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,671
The component Builder

151
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,023
Knows that and so well I know that is why I coded it in

152
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:35,423
So that it will anyway make sure that we storing it JSON Object and not just the array itself

153
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
And so

154
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:42,591
This is just looking at the check boxes and other JSON items

155
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,615
for the view

156
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
And

157
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,455
So for most things

158
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
That we are looking at the UI

159
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,111
If we are not sure how the implementation works

160
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:01,023
Looking at the code is the quickest way to actually understand what would be the way to select and now

161
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,583
That means if you're not a PHP developer

162
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:06,399
And you cannot figure out where this line

163
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,495
Or this that particular area of code is being addressed

164
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,311
Then obviously this is to your own

165
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,615
Disadvantage

166
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
But if you're able to

167
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
Read PHP

168
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:24,319
Then the compiler itself leaves in the

169
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
In the XML files and

170
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:31,231
Another files that you are building wait

171
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
I'm way off line here

172
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,327
in other

173
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
Models of things that it's building

174
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,447
It is showing you in which file

175
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
It is actually building this part of this group

176
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
And exactly on what line

177
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:51,967
So that is the way for you to get in there and see exactly what is being done

178
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,367
And that will also help you to determine what you need to change for it to possibly work if it isn't working

179
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:02,463
Now there is no way for me to avoid this

180
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,791
And the reason why there is no way to avoid them

181
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
by Joomla themselves

182
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,703
Ok so going back to just a normal text field

183
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
We would just leave it

184
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,263
to

185
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,031
Default

186
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,591
These other options of encryption

187
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
We will explain in a later video

188
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
And possibly will not

189
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,783
Ever use these

190
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,879
I had the need for them in a component that I had to develop

191
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:33,951
And so I added those features in

192
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:37,279
And at this stage it's really

193
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,607
Quite difficult to implement

194
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
If you do not have many

195
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
Let me put it this way

196
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
The basic one

197
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
Which is actually more secure if you would ask certain people

198
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Is easy to implement

199
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,663
But the advanced one

200
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,015
Which is for other purposes than just your normal encryption

201
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,599
Is a little bit more advanced and difficult to implement

202
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,207
So for now if you're not that advanced in your programming skills then

203
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
You should just avoid these

204
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:11,327
This base64 is often used

205
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,631
where you're storing code into the database

206
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,495
Most of component Builders areas where you can add custom scripting

207
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,079
Is using this base64

208
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,127
As the story method

209
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,991
Ok so now here if we gonna create an email field

210
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,367
And I'm gonna say that it should not be required

211
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
I'm gonna change this to

212
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,207
255

213
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
Leave this to default

214
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:42,815
Change that

215
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,839
to Email

216
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:46,399
This is the name surnames

217
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
We

218
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,215
Uzusally don't do uppercase

219
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:54,847
And then

220
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,431
That's what's gonna be used for the database right

221
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,967
So this field

222
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
All over

223
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:03,295
The system and all the code

224
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Is gonna be called by that

225
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Name

226
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,903
Email

227
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,183
Underscore

228
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Sorry

229
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
Lowercase

230
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Email

231
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,887
And here the name

232
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
The label

233
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
Is what will be visually seen in the form

234
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
So

235
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
There we'll be adding enter email

236
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:31,967
We'll leave the text size the same Max length is good

237
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:36,575
I'm not gonna use the default field and it is if I sorry did

238
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,647
default is optional so I can just leave it out

239
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,439
Description

240
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:43,743
I'm gonna say add enter

241
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Email

242
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
okay

243
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,823
we're remove those we're going to leave required to

244
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
False

245
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
To ensure that it isn't required

246
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,991
And then I'm gonna use validate email

247
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
And

248
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
I'm not gonna use the field option

249
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,951
The field option is to validate against another field that they both equal

250
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
Each other

251
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
We don't need that for this field

252
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
I'm here I'm gonna place demo

253
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,423
Come on

254
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,455
And

255
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,735
I'm gonna leave those out

256
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
So there we have an email field

257
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,599
Now this validate

258
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Option

259
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
There are some custom validating

260
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
option in Joomla

261
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
Email is one of them

262
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
Then there is a way to create

263
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,727
Your own validation

264
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
And

265
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:03,871
The way to implement that would be to write PHP up for that so you need to know

266
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
You know what's needed to

267
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,455
Write your own validation

268
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
And to place it

269
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,575
via the custom adding in our fields

270
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Sorry files

271
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
To place it in the correct location

272
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Where the Joomla

273
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,583
Form builder will be able to get that field validation type

274
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
And add it into your field

275
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
So if you know

276
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
What I'm talking about

277
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
Then you will know where to place it

278
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
And you'll later see that in the component

279
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,383
itself it has an option to add custom

280
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Files

281
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
And how to map it to the correct location

282
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,063
Then you can use your own validation figure type there

283
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,391
To extend on the validation options

284
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:53,791
But currently component builder itself doesn't do you know extra custom validating

285
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,607
Options it only uses Joomla's defaults

286
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:03,519
Now that means you can also leave it out and then it doesn't do validation but it still will do filtering

287
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:08,127
And here is a list of the available filters that Joomla has

288
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
Ok so that's to create an email

289
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,735
A field

290
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
That is a text field

291
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,439
You can target these text Fields with CSS and JavaScript respectively in the list and in the

292
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Single View

293
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,303
The views plural is the list you

294
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,583
View single

295
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,655
Is the Single View will the edit view in the backend

296
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
And all Both of these are most

297
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,031
Is targeting

298
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:41,407
The editing view and the listview in relation to its backend display

299
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,735
If you extend the editing View to the front

300
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,319
Then it will also load the JavaScript to the front

301
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
But

302
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,439
You cannot extend the list to the front you need to build a custom front

303
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,791
Which we will eventually get to which is called site views

304
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:02,143
Ok so this is primarily targeting your admin area

305
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
with these scripts altough

306
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,287
Like I said you can extend the the editing one which is this view

307
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,567
the Single View

308
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,847
To the front

309
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:13,919
Which means it will also extend that to the front

310
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:17,503
The way to Target it this field

311
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
Whould be

312
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,575
That is the ID

313
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:25,439
Plus j form if you forget that

314
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,999
You could look at any other

315
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Field

316
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,167
And you'd see it says j form underscore

317
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
And then the field name

318
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,775
As a ID

319
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
I'm just using fire bug to do that

320
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
And

321
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,455
So you that means you can just infront of this e-mail

322
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:56,159
Just in front of that email you just put

323
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
Not in here though

324
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,255
But if you want to Target it

325
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
In your Java Script in your CSS let me show you

326
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
Are you there

327
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
J4

328
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,471
Underscore

329
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Now you can target it with CSS maybe color or something

330
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:25,599
That's gonna make it invisible but you can target it anyway

331
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,159
Let's make it black then

332
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
And

333
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,351
The JavaScript in the same way if you use j query

334
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Add j form

335
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
underscore in front of the form name

336
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
The field name sorry

337
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,479
And the nice thing about this

338
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Is that you can

339
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,623
Add this group to the field

340
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
And in any view where you use this field

341
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,743
The Script will

342
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Follow it

343
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
It will go along with it

344
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,607
So it will be added to that View

345
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:12,447
Dynamically you don't need to rewrite it everywhere

346
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
So soon as you working

347
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
For example I have a

348
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
I have a script

349
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,847
The means to show you

350
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,151
That I'm using for numbers

351
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
that will be

352
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,247
Nice to show you hold on for a moment

353
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,999
Ok found even a better option to demonstrate

354
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:39,839
I had to create a repeatable field

355
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
Which we will look at later as a advanced field

356
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:48,031
But inside of that repeatable field I wanted to add a

357
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
A date field

358
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,079
Now

359
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:54,687
Those of you that work with Joomla will know that you can currently

360
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Not add

361
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
A date field

362
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
Repeatable field

363
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,599
So what we did

364
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,647
And this is gonna

365
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,719
Possibly be very impressing

366
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:08,255
But let me show you

367
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,095
I simply used a text field

368
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
And I added that

369
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:14,655
To it

370
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,727
As you can see here we have PHP

371
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,519
right in this JavaScript block

372
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,407
And way to add PHP here is we would do the open brackets

373
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:29,503
Question mark PHP

374
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,783
And then again

375
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,063
Question mark close

376
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:40,255
There is an a PHP and we are adding the  j Query framework

377
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:45,631
Now this script I added to the repeated fields

378
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
Script area not to the actual text field

379
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:52,031
The reason why I didn't add it to the actual text field

380
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:56,895
Because the text field is obviously gonna be repeated right so you gonna have

381
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
10  20 whatever text fields

382
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
That that specific text field

383
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
But with this code

384
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,831
I'm able to Target

385
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:08,159
Up to 50 repeats of that

386
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Field

387
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,487
With

388
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:17,119
that saying ok field number we said at least 50 

389
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,399
And this

390
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:24,543
JavaScript area is being repeated 50 times and  incrementally

391
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,103
And so the course date field

392
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,759
Date again this ID I got from after creating repeated field I went in and looked at the ID

393
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
That field

394
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,343
Added a date picker

395
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
Can I set the value of the datepicker

396
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,439
And

397
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,231
Basically added to the field

398
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,303
And it works very well so

399
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
this custom scripting area

400
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:52,447
For JavaScript can also take PHP inside of it

401
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,495
And JavaScript

402
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,359
That will be then added to the view in which this field is gonna be used

403
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:03,711
And it's I think it's very very nice feature that we have

404
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:05,503
And it's very useful

405
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,807
It's come in very useful for myself anyway

406
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:13,695
Ok so we not gonna do that we just wanna use it for creating a simple email field

407
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,279
So we will just click save or save and close

408
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
and save and new

409
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
So that's looking at creating a text field type now let's quickly do a list view a list field

410
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,007
Sorry

411
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Not view

412
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
So we click on list

413
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,967
And we see that has

414
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,247
An option

415
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,783
aray or

416
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
String here

417
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,415
now the options are set with a zero

418
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,719
and a pipe

419
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
And then the name

420
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:52,351
In a coma now that basically represents one item

421
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,887
In the drop down

422
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
So if you see this drop down here

423
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:57,983
Then

424
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
Then that is one item

425
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
That is an item

426
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,871
That is an item ok

427
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,407
So each of those

428
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,479
Would basically be represented between the comas

429
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
The pipe

430
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,623
Makes a separation between the value being stored in the database

431
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,440
And a value being shown

432
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208


433
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,768
To the person accessing the form

434
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
Now if that value is the same value

435
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
So if it

436
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,960
If you want to store in the database the same value as the one that

437
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Is being

438
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Displayed

439
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
then you simply drop off

440
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
the bipe with the 

441
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
Initial values like that

442
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:40,736
So it will say option 1 2 and then that should be 3

443
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
right

444
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
Option 3

445
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,088
Now

446
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,880
That is another

447
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,440
Allowed way to use it

448
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Or you could say

449
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:58,912
I want one option to be viewed as having not selected anything yet so if you wanted to say

450
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
Say option 1

451
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,752
Ok I wanna add another option

452
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
You would say

453
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Please

454
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Select

455
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
option

456
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Comma

457
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:15,296
By

458
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,576
By adding

459
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,024
leave that please

460
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,584
Because it's getting too long here

461
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
Select an option

462
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,008
By adding a pipe without a value

463
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,568
Is being treated as a nul

464
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,152
So when the form when the dropdown is built

465
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,992
Then it will it will be like nothing is selected

466
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:48,320
Basically that option see select an option

467
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,976
It's exactly what I did here although this is a custom field this type field

468
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
I don't have one of those here

469
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Sorry

470
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
But just that you know

471
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,472
That will basically

472
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,776
Behave the same as that one

473
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
OK

474
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,640
And then the other values would be selecting

475
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:16,736
And I have a you can use it as it is

476
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
Or is even a total different value like that it doesn't matter just know that it possibly

477
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,744
We would make everything lowercase which if you put it that side of the pipe

478
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Now

479
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,632
This could be left

480
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Out

481
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,776
And you can fill in these information based on your requirements

482
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:42,080
So that's how you set up a list field

483
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:44,128
I hope that

484
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
Shows you what is

485
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,688
Possible

486
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,040
But as you can see this list field isn't dynamic

487
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,624
In the way that a custom field possibly can be

488
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
You see the list field here you staticly set a few values that is unchanging and which should be selected

489
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:07,168
But with the custom field type which will look at in a later video

490
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
 you can

491
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,848
I have another tables values populated the list for you

492
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,664
So as it's been created your list gets longer

493
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,064
Dynamically and will still look at that and that is obviously available but this is a

494
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:30,464
More static said it once and use it over and over where is there is actually

495
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:34,304
Were there is also a dynamic list option which I will illustrate later

496
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,864
Well that is creating a list view

497
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:38,912
Let's 

498
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:41,984
Quickly also look at a radio button

499
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
Just very similar

500
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,824
If you do

501
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
Creating a radio button

502
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,480
There is though one point to make here

503
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
If you create a radio button

504
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,344
You see that there are only two values

505
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,440
And you can add more than 2 to the list but

506
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,464
I always

507
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,000
Think of it this way

508
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,096
As soon as it becomes a list of values then use a list

509
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:14,496
A radio button should at most have 3 selections or maybe at most 4 and really depends on the

510
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:16,032
Length of the text

511
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:19,872
So if it's yes no and maybe and

512
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:22,688
No thank you oh my Yes No Maybe

513
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:26,016
Not yet decided so that's four options

514
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,320
Ok so that could be ok

515
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:32,928
But as soon as it gets a  5th value possibly you should look at a list instead

516
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:37,024
again with a radio button you can just leave it at

517
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,840
You know the default storing method

518
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
And again the field

519
00:25:43,936 --> 00:25:44,704
Attributes are

520
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
Very similar to the text attributes

521
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:48,800
 except for this

522
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:51,360
Options array option here

523
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
Then also liked the list

524
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:56,480
Field type it is separated by comma

525
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:01,856
And the store value and the display value are separated by a pipe

526
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:04,672
Now it is important to note that

527
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
You cannot use

528
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
These

529
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,304
Exclamation marks inside

530
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:20,032
Sorry not exclamation quotation marks inside of your values

531
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,336
If you wanna use

532
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:27,456
Quotations inside you need to look up the html equivalent

533
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
Of that

534
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,808
quotation marks and use that

535
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,600
And then it all

536
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:36,672
It will work but if you add a

537
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,208
Quotation

538
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,792
Inside here it will literally break off

539
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:48,192
The String right there and you have only one value show up so that's just that you know

540
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,080
Ok so that is a radio button let's look at another one quickly colour

541
00:26:54,336 --> 00:27:00,224
Colour is quite straight forward it has a default value you need to remember to set the label and the name

542
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
Always the type

543
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,808
It must not be changed

544
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,856
And if you select colour here

545
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,160
And you do change the type

546
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,280
You realise that the component builder will simply ignore what you did here

547
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,072
And also back to back

548
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,120
It will not

549
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,936
Because it is a field which

550
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,728
When we set up the field type

551
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
The type itself

552
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:26,848
Was said to be mandatory and unchanging remember

553
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
And

554
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
That's why you you cannot override it

555
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:34,784
Everything that you said to mandatory and unchanging

556
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:41,440
Will fall back to the setting that you said there in the field type and it even if you change it here it will not

557
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Change

558
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,048
Ok then there is the description

559
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:51,936
And if it's required and show on again the show on feature is something that is very nice

560
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:56,288
As we go we will get to see it in action

561
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
But you can have a field like

562
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:05,248
For example A list field which has an ID 2 which should be selected

563
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,064
So did this colourfield should show

564
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,344
So you could say

565
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:14,976
Let's say that this Fields name is

566
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,768
Access

567
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Or

568
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,840
What would be in our ideal

569
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,400
Let's say 

570
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
View

571
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
And then

572
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
One

573
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,800
Would be

574
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:31,360
If in the view field

575
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,664
The option with the

576
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Value

577
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,296
Of 1 is selected then will this field only show up

578
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
No you can have it

579
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
if 1

580
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,904
Or 4 is selected

581
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,184
Then it will show up

582
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,256
And this implementation is your Joomla

583
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,584
Default implementation of the show on field

584
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:57,472
Unfortunately It cannot target multiple other Fields yet as far as I know

585
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,776
And that's why we have

586
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,872
in component builder our own implementation which is far more advanced

587
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:07,200
And which will look at once we get to views

588
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,296
Ok so that's just looking at colour

589
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,320
And and

590
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,600
Let's see

591
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,208
Another one that's quite interesting is category I suppose

592
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,512
In category

593
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
You have

594
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Extension

595
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:28,960
And this extension if you read it

596
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:35,360
Is the name of the extension for which the category will be retrieved for example

597
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:41,760
To list content categories use the value com content

598
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,576
You can add also target 1

599
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
View

600
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,160
Use the value

601
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,232
Com underscore component Dot view

602
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,864
What that means is that you can just by adding the category field

603
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
to a

604
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
View

605
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,192
You

606
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:06,592
Automatically add a category to your component so it will you don't need to map the category at all

607
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,408
in fact you cannot map with even if you wanted to

608
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Joomla

609
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:14,016
Already has a category component in place

610
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:20,416
And if you add a category well this category type field to which we are looking at now obviously you can

611
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,208
Add your own category

612
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
View

613
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:27,840
And then use a custom field to link it's values to you to other views

614
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,960
But if you are gonna use  Joomla's category implementation that integrates with your component

615
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:39,360
Then this is the way you do it and then you don't write anything for the category area 

616
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:45,760
Because Joomla do that itself and adds it to your component dynamically and the only thing

617
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:48,320
You need to do is actually an extension

618
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:53,952
Add your components name now we haven't looked at your component name

619
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,232
And that

620
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:59,072
In fact I think we possibly come back to category

621
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
When we have

622
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,424
Come to you know that area of

623
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:08,032
Sermon distributor and where we add in categories to certain views

624
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
But that you know

625
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
The categories

626
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
Can also be targeting just a specific view instead of the whole component itself

627
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:23,904
So it can only be related even to just one specific View

628
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:30,560
Which makes it nice that means you can have a category for listviews you can have a category for

629
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:35,424
 that you can have a category for this you can have multiple categories in one component

630
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
This is maybe an overkill but it's none the less possible and the way you do that is

631
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,896
Simply your component name

632
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,456
 and the specific views name

633
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,784
And obviously the view must be in singular

634
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,904
You you cannot target a list view it must be a editable Single View

635
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:58,720
So it is only saying View

636
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,144
Ok so that's looking at category will look at category again later stage where we actually will implement it

637
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,752
Editor is also a very Common Field

638
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,800
Which were often using

639
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:19,200
And the editor is what is in your Joomla content article manager is that big block in which you articles are placed

640
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,784
To here you can add such a block to your component

641
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:24,576
And

642
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
There are some

643
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:32,256
Important things like the buttons and if you read the description we have here it explains to you how it works

644
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,560
And including the

645
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:35,840
Hide option

646
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:39,424
And what kind of editor you want to load

647
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,264
Obviously You're preferrable one and the alternative one

648
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:46,080
Desired or alternative 

649
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:52,480
And the button option here is really like I said you can read it

650
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,040
Hide buttons based on what you selected

651
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:59,648
And then you have a filter option here and required

652
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:06,048
Basically again your normal attributes as with with other field types

653
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
In Joomla

654
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:13,472
Since most of them are extending your base field in Joomla and then

655
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,544
Type in name and label and defaulted

656
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,616
These things are also available to all the others

657
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,432
So that's quickly the editor

658
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:24,992
let's see

659
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,528
Media

660
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,344
Just make sure with media that you

661
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
Select the correct directory

662
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,256
If none is set I think it falls back to images

663
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,400
but you can target with a specific directory inside of images

664
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,728
And I can see there it's mandatory so you need to set it

665
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,568
And you can only Target

666
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:54,688
Images itself which is a limitation from Joomla side

667
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:01,344
So that that directory starts at images right so says the attribute should be relative to the top level

668
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
Images folder

669
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:09,536
So that means let's see you you want to Target a specific folder inside images

670
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:10,560
called foo

671
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
Then you would add that they're like that

672
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:18,240
And then preview if an image is been selected do you want

673
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:21,056
Image to be able to be previewed

674
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:26,432
By hovering over the side of the field and you just change it to true if you want to

675
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:32,576
Again the show on feature is here in the other default concepts that we've already discussed

676
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,928
Another one that's nice Is notes

677
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:42,816
Notes is basically above a field or like here if we said this is a note

678
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,864
that you see here

679
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,936
And so you can add notes

680
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,728
Around your fields

681
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,288
And it has very nice

682
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,336
Implementation right over there

683
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,872
But you can read through

684
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
And

685
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:01,248
Yeah I think that will be all for us looking at field types

686
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:06,112
Well basically looking at the basic field types or

687
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,672
Common Field types

688
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:12,256
If there is any other feel types with you felt

689
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
You need help with

690
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,584
Please look up the

691
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:20,448
Joomla documentation since the implementation is more or less a straight forward

692
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
Trying to not

693
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
Redesign the wheel

694
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:27,360
We simply trying to implement Joomla's way of doing it

695
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,736
And if there is a field type you need more information on you can simply

696
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:39,392
Go look at Joomla's documentation on that field type and if they don't have documentation then

697
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:41,440
Can you can go into

698
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
The field

699
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:44,512
Like I said libraries

700
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
there are 3 places to look

701
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,840
CMS

702
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:51,680
Joomla and Legacy in the libraries folder

703
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,984
Is the places where these Fields of found

704
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:57,056
So if you look under the CMS folder you got

705
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
 captcha field type

706
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:02,944
chromestyle content editor so there's the editor

707
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,016
So you wanna know if there is more attributes that

708
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Can be used in editor

709
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
You can open the editor and look through the code

710
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,928
And see the

711
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
The attributes that are

712
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:22,400
Being implemented across the board here it set height with $ value author value

713
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,984
author field set So It Goes On

714
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,104
And if you see that there is a attribute that we are not already targeting

715
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,152
You can like I have to explain

716
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,456
Go to the field type open it

717
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,736
Add the attribute

718
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
Add the name add the value set with it is mandatory obviously I think if we left it out it's not

719
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,280
And whether it's translatable translatable is an important concept

720
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:55,168
Which not all fields are translatable and And when a field is translatable

721
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,520
Sermon sorry component builder basically translate it for you

722
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
So

723
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
If you look at

724
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
The

725
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
It's use this acronym for example

726
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,040
You see I added there the label as acronym

727
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:17,696
Then while component builder builds this field into your component it takes that value

728
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,976
And it

729
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:24,096
Converts it into a translatable string which adds it to the language file

730
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,888
And it adds that

731
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:31,008
In here so that if somebody updates the language file that updates everywhere in the system

732
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,312
Which is basically means that

733
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:38,432
Languages are implemented everywhere in component Builders components

734
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,320
All the components it's building it translates label for everything that you said to be translatable

735
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,624
So if we If we look at

736
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
Let's go look at a certain

737
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,744
Field type like text

738
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
Any property

739
00:37:56,096 --> 00:38:00,192
That you said is translatable like here the label is yes

740
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:03,264
And description is yes

741
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,824
And that seems to be it

742
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:10,688
Hint is also translatable it's also said to yes

743
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,784
Means that 

744
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
Component Builder

745
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,368
Will dynamically take hint

746
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:24,000
And translated into a language string added to your language file

747
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:29,120
And replace the XML with the language string like it's done here

748
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,448
So

749
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:34,496
That is

750
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,568
How you can extend existing field types

751
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,640
And create Fields with them

752
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:43,200
I hope that is

753
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:47,040
Good enough for you to get your hands into

754
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,368
or to get excited about it in to use it

755
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:54,208
Obviously having Fields might still feel very

756
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,512
Primitive 

757
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,328
And so next up will be looking at

758
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,632
Adding those Fields to views

759
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:06,240
And basically making building your view

760
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,008
Itself
