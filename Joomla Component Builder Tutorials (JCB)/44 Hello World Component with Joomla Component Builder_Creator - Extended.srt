1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:05,632
I would like to give you a tutorial on how to build a hello world

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:06,912
Component

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,240
With Joomla component Builder

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
Joomla component Builder

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
Is a

6
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:15,616
Joomla component

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
Which

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,456
Helps you to develop

9
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
Joomla components

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:25,088
Quite easily

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,952
I originally developed this application or extension

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,280
For myself just so that I can

13
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
Maintain the code

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,376
In a very consistent

15
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,912
And

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
Shareable way

17
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:44,032
For example since there are lot of

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:48,640
Concepts in any components that build that you build for Joomla

19
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:51,456
Which we could call conventions or

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,248
Boilerplate

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Implementation

22
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,904
These things are usually always the same

23
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,232
And so I wanted something like a wire frame

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,376
That could just take care of all that for me all the time and even if Joomla was to change

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,448
I could just make a change in one place

26
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,544
And then compile it into all my components that I have developed

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104
And then just have them Run

28
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,944
Again stable on Joomla

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:28,320
instead of having to go to every one of those components and that means

30
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
We've gone Beyond

31
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,648
Just developing

32
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
The most basic parts of a component with actually gone and ventured into some of its complexities

33
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
And that is why

34
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
Even showing you an hello world

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,728
Component

36
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:49,056
Being built by JCB Joomla component Builder

37
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,408
It is still gonna end up being quite an advanced

38
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
Component

39
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Now

40
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,576
Since I've really mentioned to you that I really build

41
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
JCB for myself

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:09,536
And it wasn't originally intended as a community project just something that I was wanted to use

43
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:15,424
It has since become a community project and the code is open on GitHub

44
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,984
And most of you might already know that

45
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
But it also means that

46
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,360
I didn't think about the complexity

47
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384


48
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,688
When I was developing the component

49
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
I just had

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,040
Desired functionality in mind

51
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,904
And I didn't really care that it is complicated to achieve those things

52
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,232
Because I set the conventions in place

53
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,792
and I obviously know how to use them

54
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,816
And so

55
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
That's why JCB

56
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,984
On the surface might look just like any other of those component Builders out there

57
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
But when you start

58
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
Using it and

59
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,872
Knowing some of its secrets

60
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:59,456
It actually is amazing how conventions

61
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
Even

62
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,272
Conventions that you would

63
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,600
Use when you develop components yourself

64
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
would

65
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,464
Actually make JCB do things that are quite amazing

66
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,864
So you will end up realising that JCB has actually a ton of functions

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
Most of them will most of the basic ones of those we have tried or I have tried

68
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
to

69
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,384
Explain in the tutorials that you can find on YouTube

70
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,736
You can actually access the tutorials from this link here

71
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
Looking at the tutorials

72
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
Would be

73
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
The most

74
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,904
Easiest way

75
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,720
For you to discover some of JCB's

76
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
Hidden secrets

77
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,304
but at the same time

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,144
It really is only the basics although it's quite a lot of

79
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
Tutorials and

80
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,752
I know that I usually

81
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,336
Yeah I elaborate more than might maybe is necessary

82
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
And yet

83
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,992
That's because I wanna make sure that you are able to not only

84
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,064
Do basic things but even advanced things

85
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,416
If you come to JCB and you do not have PHP

86
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
As a as a language

87
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,768
But you don't know it well

88
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
And you do not know Joomla's API

89
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
Then

90
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,727
You shouldn't expect to build complex components with JCB

91
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,871
Complexity is only possible with JCB the more you know yourself

92
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:37,503
Because the more you know the more you would have a perspective on how to

93
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,063
How this implementation should function

94
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:44,671
And most of the time if you do have that perspective

95
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,255
You would start knocking and opening the correct doors

96
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,607
And set up the correct relationships

97
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,423
To have those conventions dynamically

98
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
You know be built for you

99
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
By JCB

100
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,919
If you are very good at PHP programming and you do know the

101
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Joomla API

102
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,551
You should be very happy to simply go into the compiler

103
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,879
And really start reading the code

104
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:19,999
The compilers codes files are actually

105
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,071
Alphabetically ordered ABCD

106
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,911
And so you can start with a and work your way down

107
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,031
So the first one is a underscore get the PHP and so forth

108
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,663
Reading this code and understanding how JCB's compiler

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:44,063
Constructs the code would send you on a treasure hunt where you would discover amazing features

110
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,111
That work just out of the box

111
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,439
And yet having this under the hood

112
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,535
I realise we all need to start with the basics

113
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
And that is

114
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Just to build a hello world tutorial

115
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
Just to know how to

116
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,215
Actually

117
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,007
Combine

118
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,543
The different

119
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
Concepts

120
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,383
That is required for a component

121
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,175
To be fully functional

122
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
And portable

123
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
And useful

124
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
And that's really what I want to actually

125
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
Give you a tutorial of

126
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,903
In this video

127
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:28,607
There are two concepts which I want to mention before we start

128
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:32,447
One of it is patience the other one is perseverance

129
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,775
I know within any programming career

130
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
These are invaluable

131
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,127
Aspects

132
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
Which if you have them

133
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:46,271
will make the whole difference whether you are only a normal programmer

134
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,575
Or an extremely good programmer

135
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,671
You see because those of us who have stuck around

136
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,719
and have just been going at it

137
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:57,535
We have realised that many

138
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,839
might consider us being genius

139
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
And yet

140
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,447
It's only because it's disguised by perseverance

141
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:08,287
Because we continually try and try and try

142
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Until we resolve or succeed

143
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
This is what has made JCB be possible

144
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,503
And this is also what would make you successful

145
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,039
In using JCB

146
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,623
It is not a component which I can claim has no

147
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:26,207
you know, internal conflicts or has no

148
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
Inconsistencies

149
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
But it is most certainly a component with which I am myself

150
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,143
Have developed countless

151
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:34,911
Mini

152
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,471
Programs components itself from it

153
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
Which I am maintaining

154
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,335
And I am planning to

155
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,103
Start

156
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,431
Pushing some of these components into the community

157
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,527
It's just that I have not seen the need for doing so yet

158
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,855
For the initial development were mostly

159
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,927
For clients who has directly

160
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,207
Approached me

161
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,487
Now

162
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,303
Having said all this

163
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,631
Let me take you through the basic steps

164
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
Building one piece one another

165
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
So that you would

166
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,007
Fully understand

167
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
How to build

168
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
A component

169
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,871
In JCB

170
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
I think it's self explanatory

171
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
That you would need a Joomla website

172
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,343
This Joomla website would preferably be

173
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,415
On a developing environment which is

174
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
either offline

175
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
Or on a server

176
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,279
Which isn't necessarily

177
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
you know used in production

178
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:40,191
This is not because JCB itself is unsave

179
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:44,031
Any of that it is simply just it's more convenient

180
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,567
If you have it offline

181
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,639
You can open the code in your IDE

182
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:55,039
And since JCB has the feature to extract this customised code out of your component

183
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807


184
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,903
And put it back into your component on compilation

185
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,743
A feature which will not be discussed during this tutorial

186
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,023
What does exist

187
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
A local developing environment is most ideal for this

188
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,191
I know that you could with

189
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,983
Certain

190
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,519
Yeah protocol

191
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Set up a

192
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,663
Tunnel between your desktop and

193
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,199
Your live server

194
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
And still have this kind of interaction of editing code live

195
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,831
And then compiling and

196
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,111
seeing changes

197
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,463
And that's all good because if you're able to manage that kind of complexity

198
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:38,047
I don't need to tell you anything about how to setup an environment

199
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
But what I would suggest though

200
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:44,191
Is that when you are busy trying to install JCB

201
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
And there is

202
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,055
Some limitations in a shared hosting environment

203
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
then I would

204
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
Encourage you to try and first resolve that

205
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,199
or move development offline

206
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
So

207
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
When you go to Joomla website ready obviously you would login

208
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
Having logged in

209
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,439
you would first need to install JCB

210
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,535
So I'm simply gonna go to manage and install

211
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:15,935
There are many ways for you to install JCB you could download the package you can grab the URL

212
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
From GitHub

213
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,495
You could also

214
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,031
Install it

215
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
From the web

216
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,871
It is listed with Joomla

217
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:27,455
Now if you type in JCB and search

218
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
It actually

219
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,783
Brings up JCB here

220
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
But

221
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
It would not necessarily always do that

222
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,671
I've recently discovered

223
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,207
If I type in

224
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:42,047
Component builder which is actually it's name in the listing

225
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
It doesn't even come up

226
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
Which to me was wow

227
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,423
couldn't understand how that happens

228
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,263
If you do not find a component in the search

229
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,055
This is the component

230
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,895
Then you could go down to

231
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
An area

232
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
called tools

233
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,015
And then

234
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,063
Developing tools

235
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:09,183
JCB is one of the listed developing tools

236
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:13,023
Here it is only listed as a component Builder

237
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
So you can click on that

238
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,399
And simply click

239
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,423
Install

240
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,519
This will then grab a URL from GitHub

241
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
This is the same URL

242
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
You could have just used here

243
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
As you can see

244
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,991
That would have done the same thing

245
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,063
But we can use the Joomla

246
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,599
Installer

247
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,391
And simply click install

248
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,999
This would depend on your own network

249
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,815
on how fast this takes it could take a while

250
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,119
This is quite a big file

251
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
And it's part of the places where there might be

252
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
a limitation

253
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
If used

254
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,799
Outside of a local developing environment

255
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,615
Ok we've got JCB installed

256
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,663
Now let's open it

257
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:10,111
There's just a few small things that we need to lay down

258
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,903
as foundation stones

259
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,487
In understanding how a component

260
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:18,047
Basically most Joomla components

261
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,839
Are constructed

262
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:25,215
We're Gonna Build A component called hello world

263
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,287
The way to setup a component

264
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
Is you need to first understand field types

265
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,431
Then you need to set up the fields you'll need

266
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,503
And then you need to set up the views

267
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,063
That you want in your component

268
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,111
These views also map

269
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,415
Back to the database

270
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,487
These are what we call admin views

271
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,815
So your admin views

272
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:54,911
have fields and these are usually your Database

273
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,935
columns

274
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
So these are your database tables

275
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
these are your database columns

276
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
And these

277
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,199
are your field types so you got a text field radio

278
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
List

279
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:10,783
Multiple selection

280
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:13,087
Checkbox a date field

281
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
You got many types of fields

282
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
But each field independently

283
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Is linked to a type

284
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,095
But also there are some database settings within each field

285
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:26,655
As it gets linked into the admin View

286
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Since the fields

287
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,519
Form the columns of the tables of the admin views

288
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,335
This is how you set up a component

289
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,151
Once you set up a component

290
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,431
Then

291
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,991
You basically are done with

292
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
what we would call the back end

293
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,391
The back end of the component is what always needed to be done First

294
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Well you could

295
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
Argue differently

296
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:55,839
But the point is within JCB you'd first build the back end

297
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,399
And then only add in the front end

298
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
And the front-end usually

299
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,311
Doesn't have its own database it actually pulls it's data

300
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
From the backend Database

301
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Now

302
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,943
Having explained some of that

303
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
Let's show you this in action

304
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
So in JCB

305
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
It already ships with quite a lot of field types

306
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
So we open the field types area

307
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,999
You'll see that there are many field types already setup

308
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,839
JCB is built in a way that it can be extended

309
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,119
Like subform

310
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,983
Is a new field type which was recently introduced into Joomla community

311
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
It also replaces an old field type

312
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,103
Called repeatable fields

313
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,223
Repeatable fields is a field type I would encourage you not to use anymore

314
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:49,343
Since most of you might know JCB be used repeatable feels quite excessively

315
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,951
And yet due to the fact that Joomla is now discontinuing this field type

316
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
We had to

317
00:14:55,743 --> 00:15:01,119
Migrate all of our repeatable Fields to subform Fields and it was an amazing

318
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
Huge

319
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
Process

320
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,055
But yes part of the reason why I'm redoing the hello world tutorial

321
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:13,919
It's because of the fact that subforms are now being used all across JCB

322
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,991
And there's been a little few changes

323
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
And how things are implemented

324
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,135
So here you can see all the sub this field types that I've been

325
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,183
Set up in JCB already

326
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,743
You could always add new field types

327
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,303
So as JCB

328
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:34,143
you know continues and Joomla continues to

329
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
Evolve and become better at what it does

330
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
So we will be adding more field types

331
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:42,079
And whenever we would be

332
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
Confronted by field type

333
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,711
That needs a little bit of extra tweaking within the compiler

334
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,367
I would hope to be ahead of all of you most of the time in adding that field

335
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
type in there if it needs that

336
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
Most of the time field types do not need

337
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,511
Extra help

338
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:04,351
It's only field types like subform that actually does

339
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,911
But field types like URL and

340
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,471
Text and tel and

341
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
Sequel tag it needed some extra help

342
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
But most of these don't

343
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:18,431
Because basically the way a field type works

344
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:24,063
Is that it really helps you set up what we know as the properties

345
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,599
So

346
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
The property has a name

347
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,183
It has a default value

348
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,999
It is either adjustable not adjustable

349
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,863
It's mandatory or mandatory translatable and then you can give it a little description

350
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
So that when you use the field type

351
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
You can always come back to this

352
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,567
This information can be gathered from going through the

353
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
Joomla core

354
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,151
Libraries

355
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,503
Because these field types really are only mapping Joomla's own

356
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
Implementation of these field types

357
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:00,927
So if we were to open a field type that's already been created like the text field

358
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:05,791
You see that these properties already there and in place so the field

359
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Type

360
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,095
Is text

361
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:10,399
The name is any text

362
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,727
When we say that the type is text

363
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
Then this is not adjustable

364
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
So

365
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,407
We need this unticked if it is adjustable we can tick it

366
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
It is most certainly

367
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Mandatory

368
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
And so

369
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:30,367
That is how you set up field types I'm not gonna go into this too deep

370
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
Since there is extra tutorials on how to do field types I just wanted to give you a brief overview

371
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:42,655
Or the fact that the most of the field types already are created and ready for you to use

372
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
So you'd most of the time simply start with fields

373
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:49,311
There are quite a few Fields already here

374
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:52,127
But I'm gonna go on as they are not there

375
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,919
And I'm gonna create

376
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:59,551
Basically two or three Fields that we can use in our hello world component

377
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,087
So

378
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,391
First field I'm gonna create

379
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:05,439
Click on new

380
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,743
Then I'm gonna select

381
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:12,095
Text as my field type and you see

382
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,143
That information in the field type

383
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,167
You know

384
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:19,007
Mandatory in everything all this information here

385
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:22,079
It is actually brought in by Ajax

386
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
From the field type

387
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:26,943
So if I was to click on this button here

388
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
Just to it give you a quick demonstration

389
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:35,135
And I was to

390
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,951
Just say change this to TT

391
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
Like three of them and save and close

392
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:45,887
And then go back to fields

393
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
And click new

394
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,519
Then select

395
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,847
Text field again

396
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,687
You'll see that now it added

397
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
three t's in there

398
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:04,831
Because this whole structure is being built

399
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,415
From the field types default settings

400
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
Which we just looked at

401
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,255
So I'm gonna go change that back quickly

402
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
I maybe just put a little

403
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:19,167
Something in here the description

404
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
For you to see

405
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,031
What I mean

406
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:33,247
So creating a field we haven't really started with it I've just been demonstrating the field type but okay

407
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,551
Ok I'm gonna take text again

408
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,623
And I you see those o's are showing up here

409
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
So this means that this whole area

410
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:47,839
Is actually dynamically populated from the values that are put up in the field type

411
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:51,423
And so is this XML structure here

412
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
Usually

413
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:55,007
Populates with the demo

414
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,567
Or default values that you add it

415
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
When you created the field type

416
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:06,015
The JCB ships with most field types or ready in place it appears like this is something we have done

417
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:10,111
But really it's something that you can extend and even change

418
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:15,743
So for example if you know that the text field type has more properties than we have setup

419
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,047
You can go in and add more to it

420
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:23,935
You can simply click on this you know edit here or before creating a field

421
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:26,495
You can go to the field types

422
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,823
And open the text area

423
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
Sorry the

424
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,919
Text field type

425
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
And

426
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,735
Here just click

427
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,807
The green button and add more Properties

428
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,903
And then those properties will dynamically also appear

429
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:44,927
Within

430
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
The area where you create the fields

431
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
So this again is just

432
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Wanting to show you

433
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,655
The JCB is tried it's very best

434
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
To be scalable

435
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:59,519
And basically customizable

436
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,799
To your

437
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Own desires

438
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
So that it isn't just

439
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,151
Blocked in

440
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:08,479
To what we have set hard into code

441
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:12,575
But it is movable and therefore scalable

442
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,623
So having

443
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:17,184
Looked at Field types

444
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
I think enough

445
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
Let's create our first field

446
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,120
So it's gonna be a text field we gonna call it greetings

447
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,728
So I'm gonna update the label with greetings

448
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,008
This is what

449
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:32,288
Will be visible

450
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
In the database

451
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,152
Greetings

452
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:42,272
Singular is gonna be the database name

453
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,856
I'm gonna leave most of the others just default

454
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,672
Let's see

455
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:50,720
Autocomplete is on

456
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
Validation

457
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:53,280
You know

458
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,072
We can leave all of those

459
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,888
It doesn't really matter let's just maybe change the hint

460
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Ok

461
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,920
And then I also gonna just remove the description

462
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,112
Definitely take out the default text otherwise it will always

463
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:18,880
appear

464
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,208
And now in regards to the database

465
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,768
That is what these features are all about

466
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,584
Since text Fields can differ

467
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
We didn't come

468
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,936
Out and say well all of them gonna be this size

469
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240
We left it up to you to decide

470
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,288
What kind of text field of this is gonna be

471
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
And really it's all up to you

472
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:43,712
Obviously that would mean that you would need to know a little bit more about

473
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,272
MySQL and databases

474
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
To really effectively use this

475
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:54,464
Most of the time it is available on Google so if you do not know

476
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,256
What would be the best for

477
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,816
A text field or a date field

478
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,352
You can Google that

479
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,960
Or you could simply go and look at Joomla's own implementation

480
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
It's got an article manager

481
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,336
And you can go into its XML

482
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,360
Database

483
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,152
And look at

484
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
What

485
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,480
Database

486
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,296
Values was used and just use the same

487
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,344
Whatever be the case

488
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,184
You should be able to actually navigate through this

489
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Without much problems

490
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:30,048
Since that is what is would be required

491
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
You need to

492
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,888
have perseverance you need to

493
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,656
You know

494
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,936
Be curious

495
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,472
dig through things

496
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
And doing that you will eventually succeed

497
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,872
Because these values are all movable

498
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,176
That means that setting them wrong

499
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,200
could break things

500
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,480
And

501
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:52,832
That's why I always encourage those who gonna use JCB

502
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,136
To really do a little bit of homework

503
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:57,696
And to prepare themselves

504
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
To get involved in programming

505
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
More effectively

506
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,304
That would only

507
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,608
Be beneficial to all of us I suppose

508
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:07,424
Because good programmers makes good programs

509
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,752
And makes the web a safer place

510
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,776
So

511
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,080
Having created our first field

512
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,944
I think I'm gonna just reuse name

513
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:21,504
And maybe

514
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Also description

515
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,600
Those are part of the demo

516
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:32,000
Component but since Fields can be linked into any admin view and therefore belong

517
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
To any component

518
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:38,400
It doesn't bother the fact that it is linked to the demo component already

519
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
What is though true

520
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:43,264
is that if you change it It'll actually affect both

521
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Components

522
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,080
Okay so

523
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,360
Having created

524
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
our field types

525
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,968
And also now a field

526
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,784
Let's create an admin View

527
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,672
admin views as I already explained

528
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,488
Is really the back end of your component

529
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,608
And So you'd need to do some thinking and maybe draw some up

530
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,144
there's a whole

531
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,752
A lot of tutorials around the web about object orientated development

532
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:17,056
Which talks about use cases and

533
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,384
All kinds of discussions and trying to sort of

534
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Come up with a

535
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Perspective of what do you wanna build how should it work what should be where what should have its own classes

536
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,648
What should have it own tables where we gonna put what

537
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:35,744
And really that kind of work you need to do before coming to JCB

538
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,280
JCB

539
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,072
Isn't really gonna help you with that

540
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
And so

541
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,400
Once you've got all that planned

542
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:48,032
Then you would come here create your Fields create your admin views which basically is your tables

543
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,104
And then link them to a component

544
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,896
And once you've done that

545
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:56,480
You've basically laid the foundation of your application

546
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,808
And you can start working on what will make it unique

547
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:02,112
And special which is the front end

548
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,904
So first

549
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,208
Admin View

550
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:10,048
This is the name is really just for you to identify

551
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
The View

552
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,400
If there be more than one view with the name greetings

553
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
So let's say you've

554
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,032
Built quite a few components that deals with hello world

555
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:23,360
And now you got three or four different

556
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,176
Variations of greetings

557
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,272
Now you might want to just say ok this is the first

558
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
One

559
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,576
And

560
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
By doing that

561
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:39,744
It's identifiable within the drop down list across your application of JCB

562
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:46,912
You'll see that when we would later select the greeting that the system name is used in the drop down list

563
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,032
So we're gonna have a single record and a list record

564
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,896
Single record is also what we understand as the edit View

565
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,224
So that's when you are looking at one record

566
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:03,040
And you are editing that record

567
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,624
In the admin area that's the single record

568
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,160
That's also

569
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
What will be used when you

570
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,280
Actually tweak JCB

571
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,584
To add an edit option

572
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,400
To the site area of your

573
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
Website

574
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,984
Since JCB can do that for you

575
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,264
On the fly

576
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
This single record

577
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
Would also affect

578
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,664
The front end of your component in that case

579
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,480
Which we will show and demonstrate

580
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,760
As we go along

581
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,320
So for now I'm just gonna call this

582
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Greeting

583
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:39,904
and the list record

584
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,696
greetings

585
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,560
Obviously we want to have the ability to read and write to this table

586
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,144
Now when we say this is a read only

587
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,544
It means that the data is in this actual admin area is not gonna be able to be changed

588
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,824
Via Joomla

589
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,432
Unless obviously you've added some JavaScript and some

590
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,968
Other nice

591
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:08,832
Conventions around your component that sort of creates data for that area

592
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
Dynamically as people use the component

593
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:16,768
Which that case you might use this feature but I must tell you I have hardly ever used it

594
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:23,424
I'm not even sure why I added it but it's there and I know maybe some of you might find it useful

595
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:29,056
This basically turns all the fields in the area as read only

596
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:32,384
And when you try and change them they never get

597
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,432
But you know submitted to the database

598
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,272
So we would by Default always leave it to read and write

599
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,344
Then you give it a short description

600
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,928
We'll go to settings and we'll see

601
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:45,952
That

602
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,256
Sorry Fields and conditions

603
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:54,656
We'll see that this button to create admin field conditions will show once the admin view

604
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
is saved for the first time

605
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:01,056
So you cannot add Fields to this admin view if you haven't saved it

606
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
That is one of the changes that now came in from us moving away from repeatable Fields to subform fields

607
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,272
the admin view

608
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
Is it table on its own

609
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,648
And it's relationship with the fields is also a table on its own

610
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,952
So at this stage

611
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:23,072
Unfortunately you need to first not click save and close but just save once

612
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:27,680
So that it basically creates this admin view in the database

613
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
And now

614
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,496
If you go to fields

615
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,360
And conditions you'll be able to link Fields and create conditions

616
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:42,272
We are not gonna be creating conditions since we are basically illustrating or demonstrating a very basic component

617
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
We're just gonna create

618
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
A linked fields

619
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:50,976
Linked fields are basically the fields that we created previously

620
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
So we will click on create

621
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:58,144
It's gonna ask us to be sure that all our work has been saved in the admin View

622
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,960
Because if it isn't and we click okay

623
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:01,984
It will be lost

624
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,312
So make sure your work is saved before you clicking okay

625
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,200
This will now open an area where you can link Fields to your admin View

626
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:17,600
This looks very similar to the pop-up we had with repeatable Fields except

627
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
That it's basically it's own View now

628
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
So if we click on this green

629
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Button here

630
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,768
It opens

631
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
An area where when I select

632
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
The fields we wanna use

633
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,936
So we gonna have a name field

634
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
And

635
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
That's a text field

636
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,104
We want it to show in the admin list view

637
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:43,456
We want it to show first we gonna have it behave as a title

638
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,528
we want it sortable searchable

639
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:51,904
Not filterable because then every name would be a filter that's too much

640
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:58,560
But definitely linkable this means if someone Clicks on the name it will open the greeting so

641
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,584
You can edit it

642
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,376
Now

643
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,192
We only have two tabs at this stage

644
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:07,264
I'm not gonna go into great detail about the tabs

645
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,544
This Time Round

646
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,640
If you want to know more please go through the tutorials and look up

647
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,712
Tabs to to see more on this subject

648
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,760
I'm gonna let it be

649
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
In the left

650
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,064
In the tab

651
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:23,392
And in the tab I want it to be the first item

652
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:27,232
I'm not gonna add any permissions to this

653
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:31,328
But there is an editing permission available at this stage

654
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:33,120
If you want it to

655
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,704
That would create permissions around this

656
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Field

657
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,824
Which you can tweak who can edit it and who can't

658
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:46,432
You can also control this from a global view perspective

659
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:48,224
Or on a field level

660
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:52,832
These are some of the hidden advantages the JCB has

661
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
In

662
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
Handling permissions across your component quite easily

663
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,512
Now The Next Field you wanna add is greetings

664
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,840
We want the greetings to also be in the listview

665
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144
And we want it to be second

666
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,448
Want it to be searchable

667
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,752
Sortable and searchable

668
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
And it doesn't need to be a link

669
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
We want it to be on the right

670
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:18,432
Hand in the tab and we wanted to be first

671
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,016
And sure that's basically All We Need

672
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
And they will click save and close

673
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,696
This will now basically link those Fields to this admin view

674
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,768
We now again open the fields and conditions

675
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:35,072
We will see that those fields are here

676
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,400
And with all the variations that we have selected

677
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,680
Ready-to-use

678
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:44,032
Ok so having our admin view setup

679
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,360
We can actually now go and create our component

680
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,640
So we can

681
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
either click save and close

682
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
Or we can simply click close

683
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:56,064
We haven't made any changes in this view since we've come back

684
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,136
This area is already been saved

685
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:00,928
So we could click close

686
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:05,280
But clicking save and close it's always the safe choice I suppose

687
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
So

688
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:11,168
Now that are admin view is in place

689
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,472
Let's go create the component

690
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Click new

691
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,968
We're gonna give our component a system name

692
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:29,600
Since this is the second hello world tutorial we'll call it version 2

693
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,184
Now we also gonna give it a name which

694
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,232
Is the same as the first one

695
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
Hello world

696
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,656
We're gonna give it a code Name of hello world

697
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,472
And is it's version 2

698
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496


699
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,128
Am I gonna explain too much about all these other switches

700
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:55,456
Basically just that we will need to add company names

701
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:58,016
Author name email website

702
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
And a short description

703
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,904
Now that we have those in place

704
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:07,744
The next thing to do would be to add an admin View

705
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,608
Now since the admin view can only be added once the component's been saved

706
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,400
For the first time

707
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Let's save it

708
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
Great our component has been saved

709
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,736
Opening the admin view we now can link

710
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,784
Admin views to this component

711
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,600
There are two places to do this

712
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
Under settings

713
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
You can click on component admin View

714
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
you can click on this one here

715
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:43,584
Or you could in the admin views click on create

716
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,656
Both these buttons take you to the same place

717
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,960
This used to be The Old Way

718
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:52,800
In how people would add admin views to their component

719
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,592
And that's why we left it here

720
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:01,248
But within the new JCB after our transition away from repeatable fields

721
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:05,344
We actually can handle all of it within the admin tab admin view tab

722
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,880
Just click create

723
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:10,720
We are sure we have saved all our work so we can click ok

724
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:18,144
Again we are faced with something that looks very similar to when we were linking the fields

725
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
except that now

726
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,472
We are dealing with the admin view

727
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,312
Linking admin views to this component

728
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:28,128
So I'm gonna click on this plus button here

729
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,176
To open our first line

730
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
We basically just wanna

731
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
Link The greeting

732
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,088
We gonna leave the default icon

733
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:38,368
Of

734
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,648
Joomla

735
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,976
But there are a whole list of icons available

736
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,512
These icons

737
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,864
Are icon moons which are the Joomla default icon

738
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,680
That are part of the Joomla backend

739
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:53,472
And front-end I suppose

740
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,520
And you can search this

741
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
Just

742
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,360
Search that phrase I suppose

743
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,664
And you will find on

744
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,224
Joomla's website

745
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
A whole

746
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
Picture map of all these icons

747
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
Then I most certainly want this view to be

748
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,648
Part of the main menu

749
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:13,696
I want an add record

750
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,512
On the dashboard I want a list

751
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,608
That means clicking on something and it shows us the list of greetings

752
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,912
I want it in the submenu

753
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,960
The auto checking feature

754
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,240
Basically

755
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,080
Components get checked out when somebody

756
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Not components items

757
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,152
So when you

758
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
Create a record

759
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:39,296
That are stored in the database and someone else comes and wants to edit that record

760
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,904
You wanna prevent people from working on the same record at the same time

761
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,208
Since one of them is gonna lose their work

762
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,536
So Joomla has this feature by which

763
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
You can check out an item

764
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:58,240
And then when someone else tries to open it it tells them hey sorry it's not been it's not available it's

765
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,008
Checked out

766
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:02,848
The problem with seeing though is that this check out

767
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,408
Can be problematic

768
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,224
Because people don't save

769
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,296
They just open it maybe to have a look at it

770
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:14,368
And then instead of clicking cancel or close

771
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,648
They just click back

772
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:19,488
And the item doesn't get checked back into the database

773
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:23,840
So the auto check in feature is a nice add-on that JCB has

774
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,120
set place

775
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,192
Which basically you can set that an item

776
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,496
Which are checked out longer than a day

777
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:32,288
Is obviously one that was missed

778
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,848
And should be checked in automatically

779
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,128
This

780
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,432
Is one of the reasons why

781
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:41,248
I developed JCB because I have all these

782
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,784
little tweaks that I

783
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
Want in all my views but I

784
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
Know that

785
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:49,696
If Joomla changes something and I need to change this little tweak

786
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:54,816
Going to every single view is like so cumbersome

787
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:58,400
So here it simply click whether you would like this

788
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:05,056
And if Joomla makes a change that we need to know adapt this feature we just change it in the compiler and it

789
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:09,664
Immediately you know compiles correctly for all the components mapped in it

790
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:14,784
The other feature which I think is also great is this keeping of History

791
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:21,184
If I want to keep track of all the changes made to any item of greeting

792
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,744
Then I just need to tick this

793
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
Keep history

794
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,400
And JCB will dynamically add all the needed structures so the Joomla's

795
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,520
Integrated history component will work alongside your third-party component

796
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:38,592
And keep track of every item and it's changes

797
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,944
So that is just a tick box and JCB does the work

798
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,552
The has metadata basically adds

799
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,112
The metadata Fields to the view

800
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:54,720
So you don't need to add them it gets added just by ticking this box

801
00:38:55,232 --> 00:39:00,096
Then also does this field view have access public

802
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
Special or

803
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,424
you know registered

804
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,216
All these access levels

805
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:11,616
Do you want to implement these levels of access on this view usually you would use this

806
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:17,760
If you want the view to be actually be editable on the front end of the site

807
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:21,088
Because then you will use the access

808
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,880
To control some of these

809
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:25,696
I'll show you more of that as we go along

810
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
So I'll just take this as yes

811
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,048
I wanted to have an import function

812
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
And like we said

813
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:36,192
We want to add a site edit and create view for this admin View

814
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Yes

815
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
And then

816
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
We want it to be first

817
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:47,456
So this admin view basically is gonna have all the features that an admin view can have

818
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
By Default in JCB

819
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:55,904
And as you would realise when we start demonstrating it although it's as easy as ticking this box

820
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,744
The code that JCB is gonna write to do this implementation

821
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
Is quite stable

822
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
And yet

823
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,168
Dynamic that as Joomla evolves and changes

824
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,216
We can tweak these codes

825
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:14,080
In the compiler and make sure that it remains stable this way

826
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
Good now save and close

827
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:22,528
Now that we have linked this admin view to the component

828
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,368
We can all go to admin views and we'll see this admin view

829
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,976
We'll even see the icon we can click on this

830
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:37,120
little pencil here and this will actually take us to the admin View

831
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,728
Obviously again making sure that all your work is being saved in this area

832
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,776
Click okay if it is

833
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:47,360
And you'll see that it opens the admin view where we linked

834
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
The fields

835
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:51,456
And we can actually how work in the admin view

836
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
From the component

837
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,904
Now there are areas in the admin view I didn't demonstrate like the permissions the tabs the link to views

838
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,976
And I'm not going to going to do much of that

839
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
I'm just gonna add

840
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,304
Some permissions

841
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
Because I want to demonstrate

842
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
The permissionable structure

843
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:15,264
Regarding the front in management of editing these items

844
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:22,432
I'm just gonna use the core there is the option of using what is known as the view edit

845
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:27,808
Instead of core edit then it means it's relationship is just for this view

846
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,880
I want it to be related to the Core

847
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:35,744
Which means that it's not gonna be only related to this view

848
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,816
But whatever I change in the Core will affect this view

849
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:43,680
For more explanation on the permissions there is this tutorial

850
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:46,496
Which is available in the description

851
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
And you can go watch this tutorial

852
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,824
And also

853
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,640
Maybe do some changes compile the component

854
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,175
And look at the code

855
00:41:54,687 --> 00:42:00,831
Look at the code and look at the code that's all I can say for most questions being asked because the code

856
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,623
Really tells you what has been done

857
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,207
There is many ways for you to learn

858
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,255
How JCB does things

859
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,303
By making changes

860
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,911
And then compiling your component and looking at what changed

861
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,055
Usually using something like git will be very useful in Discovering the changes

862
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,455
There's also a way for you to know where in the compiler specific code is being created

863
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:31,039
Which I will show you as we continue

864
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,903
So since we've made changes I'll simply click on save and close

865
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,463
And this will take us back to the component

866
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,839
So being back in the component

867
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:45,375
We'll see that

868
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
Everything is still the way we left it

869
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
And

870
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
quite a few things around

871
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:55,103
The admin view which I'm not gonna go into depth

872
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
During this tutorial

873
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:00,735
I would encourage you to watch the tutorials that are already online

874
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:04,063
For actual explanation on all these features

875
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:08,159
But to demonstrating a hello world component we have done quite enough

876
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,951
Regarding the back end

877
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,535
So all that now remains

878
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,375
It's basically to compile so we'll click save and close

879
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,239
And we'll go to the compiler

880
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
Select our component

881
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,127
And compile

882
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:30,687
Great

883
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:33,247
That means we've just written

884
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,295
9000 lines of code

885
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:39,647
created 51 folders in 122

886
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,183
Files

887
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:44,255
And if we were to have manually

888
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,631
Written this without any boilerplate tool or

889
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:51,167
You know wire script

890
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:55,007
That could help us write all the classes and tables and stuff

891
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:58,847
And it took us 5 seconds to write one line

892
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
It would have taken us

893
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
25 Hours

894
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,783
Or about three 8 hour days

895
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:10,623
That's a long it would have taken you to do this manually

896
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:15,487
So just right there JCB's  already saved you quite a lot of time

897
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:20,607
Now the component can be installed by Simply clicking this button

898
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,631
Or

899
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,655
Grabbing

900
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,215
The URL and going to the

901
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Normal installer

902
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,311
Because it has actually

903
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,359
Compiled a

904
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
Shippable

905
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:35,455
Joomla component package

906
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,551
Which can be installed on any Joomla component

907
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,599
Sorry any Joomla website

908
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
Now one thing I didn't do

909
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
Is I didn't actually select

910
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
A

911
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:54,399
Component image so when we selected you see there is no image showing as there is with this one

912
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
So

913
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,983
I think I wanna quickly go back

914
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,311
I'm gonna clear the temporary folder and just go select

915
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:06,175
At least the demo components image as our hello world component

916
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,807
So in the component there is this area to select an image I'm gonna click select

917
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,367
And I've selected

918
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,415
The demo components package

919
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:20,767
It says that we have something so I'm gonna save and close again

920
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:24,351
And now go back to the compiler

921
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,215
And compile it again

922
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,823
Now I'm gonna click on install

923
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:41,759
If I now go here we'll see that there is now a new component in this Joomla website

924
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:44,319
And I'm gonna open in a new tab

925
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,415
And there we go we got our component installed

926
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:53,023
It has a greetings tab and a add greetings tab

927
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,095
We also have not selected images for those

928
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,399
So let's quickly do that

929
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:01,471
Gonna go back to the admin views

930
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:03,007
And then the greetings

931
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,287
I'm gonna click

932
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:06,591
On greetings First

933
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,151
As an admin View

934
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:13,247
And here you see there is a place for icons and the add icon

935
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,039
I'm gonna select

936
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,575
So I've selected

937
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:21,439
This little bucket as the icon for greetings

938
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,999
I'm gonna just add one for

939
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,119
For adding a greeting with a little

940
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,399
Green Plus

941
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
Now we got it to icons

942
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,751
I'm gonna click save and close

943
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,335
so now

944
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,615
I've got greetings

945
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,639
Set up

946
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
And

947
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:46,015
I'm gonna go and compile this again

948
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:50,367
That's usually how things go we go make a change

949
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,439
We come back to the compiler to compile it install it

950
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,231
And go look at the component

951
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
And

952
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Also

953
00:46:58,047 --> 00:47:00,095
When it getsa  little bit more advanced

954
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:03,679
We not only go and look at the component in Joomla

955
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,727
But we also go and look at the code

956
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:11,103
So there we got it the two icons are in place if I click add on greeting

957
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:14,943
We see that there's the name there's the greeting

958
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,295
And there's also all these other Fields added by Default

959
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,415
So the created and the metadata and the permissions

960
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,951
Are all in place

961
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
That is

962
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,095
How you would set up a basic

963
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,887
Hello world component

964
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,679
Go to the options

965
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,239
Will see that it has this

966
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
Check in timer

967
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:42,847
And you can change it to 5 hours

968
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:46,175
What I explained you know the checks in the items

969
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,223
We also have

970
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:51,039
The history version enabled

971
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:56,159
And set to remember 10 versions of any item created

972
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,183
As a greeting

973
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:01,279
We also have the permissional structure in place

974
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:04,095
Which includes the greeting

975
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:07,935
Access greetings batch dashboard and so forth

976
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,983
Which are all

977
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:14,591
The switches related to the greetings area

978
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,527
So now that we have the admin area basically done Let's continue to

979
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,927
The front-end I'm gonna illustrate to you on the front-end how to view greetings

980
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:35,327
That were created how to edit greetings that were created and how to add more

981
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:41,727
Greetings from the front end to this component

982
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:48,383
Let's close out of the components edit area the first thing we need to do

983
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
We need to create what is known as a dynamic get there 2 ways to get to the dynamic get

984
00:48:55,039 --> 00:49:01,183
Area one is to click on this add Dynamic get

985
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:07,583
The others would be basically in the sub menu to go to Dynamic get and then

986
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:13,983
Click new we're gonna need two Dynamic gets we gonna need

987
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:20,383
one to basically return a list of greetings

988
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:26,783
And then we'll need one to return one greeting because one the one Dynamic get is gonna

989
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:33,183
Return for us all the greetings that are available and published the second

990
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:39,583
one is when we click on one of those greetings it should open only that greeting

991
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:45,983
So we gonna use the name as who is being greeted and then the greeting will

992
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:52,383
Will only show when we actually click on the name and then show that individual's

993
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:58,783
Greeting so that's part of how we think about this at this stage then

994
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,183
In this area where we can see the full greeting we are gonna add and edit button

995
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:11,583
And in the list area we are gonna add a create button but these create and

996
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:17,215
Edit buttons are gonna be controlled by the permissional structure which JCB

997
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
Puts into your component by you just saying that it should be there so setting up a

998
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:30,015
Dynamic get is quite easy you first know that ok I'm gonna use a back end view

999
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:36,415
Which is related to my component and then I'm gonna select that back end view

1000
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,815
You see it says greetings first so like I said before with a system name

1001
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:47,167
What is used in the dropdowns so here we select greetings (First)

1002
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:53,567
This one is going to bring back a list query we don't want any pagination

1003
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,359
And

1004
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:59,199
I really don't need all of this we don't need

1005
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,479
The asset ID

1006
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,599
We can leave the created by

1007
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,903
And the created

1008
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:13,279
We can take out the modified the version we can also leave

1009
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,071
The hits

1010
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,655
And the ordering that's fine now

1011
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:25,055
The greeting we most certainly don't need in a list we only need the name now

1012
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:31,455
Ok let's give it a name that we can sort of identify when we start setting up the site view

1013
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,247
We call this

1014
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
List

1015
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,319
Greetings

1016
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,135
And then in brackets

1017
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
Name only

1018
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:46,559
So we know ok this is what it is going to save that

1019
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:53,727
You didn't need to save it we could have just gone right into tweaking the data without saving

1020
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:59,615
What the data tweak gives us is it gives us a little bit of control on the writing

1021
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:06,015
The JCB will do regarding this query so for example we want it to be

1022
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
Before did

1023
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:10,111
Now the ordering is called ordering

1024
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,927
a.ordering

1025
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,719
So we want to order it

1026
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:20,351
Ascending by the order set in the database

1027
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:25,471
The other filter we want to add

1028
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,775
Is we wanna make sure

1029
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,847
That it only returns published items

1030
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,151
So in the

1031
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:36,735
"Where" area replace published

1032
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
And we say equal 1

1033
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:45,951
so only published values be returned there are some other features

1034
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:52,351
Around the tweak area which I suppose goes beyond just in the normal Hello World Component

1035
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:58,751
But there are tutorials about this on Joomla sorry on YouTube in that playlist

1036
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:05,151
That I've already referred to quite a few times, then there's a joint area which we not gonna use

1037
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:05,919
But

1038
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:10,783
It is a very nice way of linking to other

1039
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:17,183
component tables that I've got any kind of relationship that needs to be in a

1040
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,071
relationship between the main table and the join table but like I said

1041
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:29,471
When I'm gonna go into this we are simply going to do the most basic which is what we've got here

1042
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:35,871
And we gonna say save a new so we can do and another one

1043
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:39,967
The next one is this gonna be a greeting

1044
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:46,367
Just simple greeting we wanted to be one item again we gonna do a back end view

1045
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,415
Again from the greetings list

1046
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:50,719
This time we really

1047
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:57,119
Want the name and a greeting we can still use the published we don't need to modify

1048
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
By

1049
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:05,567
We can leave those we don't need ordering we could have left out the head

1050
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:11,711
In the previous one we set up now let's do a little tweak to make sure that it

1051
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,783
Doesn't allow someone to grab

1052
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,855
An unpublished value

1053
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:25,279
By just adding an ID in the URL or something ok so that's ok

1054
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
Got this

1055
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
Oh yes

1056
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,375
Now we need to add a filter

1057
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:32,191
We gonna use the ID

1058
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:36,031
Basically passing the ID via the URL

1059
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:41,151
So the state will be ID and

1060
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:47,807
It is gonna be a.id equals so that's really what makes the item load

1061
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:54,207
Is this filter type and there are many ways to load items

1062
00:54:54,463 --> 00:55:00,607
And yes this is a little bit more complex than you might wanted to be but believe me

1063
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,143
It gives you freedom

1064
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,983
And ability to build quite amazing things

1065
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,263
And so

1066
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:11,615
Please go and watch the tutorial on Dynamic get on GitHub

1067
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,663
There is actually a place

1068
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
I just show you

1069
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,247
Called Wiki

1070
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:21,855
And in the Wiki there is links to all the different tutorials

1071
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
And here is the dynamicGet

1072
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,719
And you should really watch all of that

1073
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:28,767
Even the second one

1074
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:35,423
And yeah well my encouragement is to really watch everything I have often seen people ask question

1075
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,983
In the issue area

1076
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:40,543
Which are dealt with in the tutorials

1077
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
I'm sorry

1078
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:48,479
We all have a lot of things to do and so if I don't answer this questions but simply point you to the tutorial

1079
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,271
I hope you understand

1080
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:58,719
Ok so we've got in the dynamicGet all the value selected that we want and

1081
00:55:58,975 --> 00:56:00,767
Also how to limit it

1082
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
The tweak is in place

1083
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:05,887
And the limiting factors

1084
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:09,727
We don't need to join it to any other tables,we simply going to

1085
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,263
Return these values

1086
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:13,311
Let me see

1087
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:17,151
We could add the username values if we wanted

1088
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:25,087
So we wanted to show who created this we could say created by

1089
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:25,855
go to joint

1090
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:33,279
Click on the joint a database tables not view because we want to use

1091
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,815
The user

1092
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,631
Table

1093
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,983
And we basically want

1094
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
A single

1095
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,359
Item returned

1096
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,407
And here it will be

1097
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:51,199
Created by

1098
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,479
And

1099
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,063
In the joint field it will be

1100
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,367
b.id

1101
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,183
And we basically want, let's see

1102
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:03,743
The username that's it

1103
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:13,215
We don't need the ID, we already got that so just the username

1104
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:16,287
And we could just say

1105
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,639
Let's call it

1106
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Creator

1107
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
Or

1108
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,015
Greeted

1109
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783


1110
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:36,767
Greeted by, ok so he's the one sending the greeting

1111
00:57:37,023 --> 00:57:39,071
save and close

1112
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,887
So now we've got two

1113
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:48,287
Dynamic gets a list greeting and a greeting this is what you need to build first basically

1114
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:54,175
Again starting at the database looking at what is the data I want

1115
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,223
On the page

1116
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:59,551
What do I want to show the people looking at the page

1117
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:05,695
And by that determining really what the data is you going to grab from the database

1118
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:07,999
And giving it system names

1119
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,279
That are

1120
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,095
Identifiable because now

1121
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,423
The next thing to do is to create a site View

1122
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:18,751
now there is such a thing as layouts and templates

1123
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,567
That all can work together with site views

1124
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:23,871
I'm not gonna illustrate that now

1125
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:30,271
or demonstrate it, basically if you want to know more about that look at the tutorials

1126
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:33,087
On YouTube I'm just simply going to build

1127
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,623
Two site views

1128
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:37,695
And yeah let's go ahead and do that

1129
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,815
Ok, the first site view we gonna call

1130
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,375
Greetings

1131
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:49,983
And we gonna give it a name called

1132
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,031
Greetings

1133
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
And a code name

1134
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
Greetings

1135
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
Now the code name is significant because you don't want to Clash with admin views that you've already created

1136
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
That are gonna be

1137
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,927
Edit views on the front

1138
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:12,255
So since the listview is not being

1139
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:18,655
Placed on the front of your component only the edit view that means edit views name

1140
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,191
Name is greeting

1141
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:23,263
So we can't set a code Name

1142
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,103
For the front called greeting otherwise they will actually

1143
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,383
you know conflict

1144
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:33,759
So I'm just gonna use greeting and for the Single I'm gonna use greet

1145
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,807
Ok so

1146
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:41,439
Just give you a little explination on why I'm doing things the way I'm doing it

1147
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:44,767
So a little description here

1148
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,447
I'm gonna just

1149
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,751
Place a little

1150
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:57,567
Heading

1151
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:11,903
And adding it like that will actually mean

1152
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:16,767
That this little string will get added to your language file

1153
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:21,631
So that's how you create language strings it's just adding the snippet

1154
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:27,775
Oh or even just this anywhere in JCB will actually create a language string

1155
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,079
Ok, now over here

1156
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:36,479
We are going to select the list greeting and the reason why there are two of these

1157
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:42,879
Is it the one is what we will act upon in the compilation the other one is just for you to look

1158
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,439
So if you end up

1159
01:00:45,695 --> 01:00:48,511
Let's say in here and click save

1160
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:53,631
It will not be playing any role whatsoever in the compilation

1161
01:00:53,887 --> 01:01:00,031
It will play a role when you export a JCB package but that's a whole different subject and not going to deal with

1162
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:05,663
that, so good practice would be that these two actually are the same

1163
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:11,551
The main and the Dynamic Get but since you can add Custom Gets

1164
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:17,439
We don't have any Custom Gets setup so you can't select any, but you can add more than just

1165
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:20,767
Your normal main gate to a site View

1166
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:27,167
You can add the main Get and then a bunch of custom gets which brings a whole ton of data to the

1167
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:33,567
Page from different variations from relationships which I know it's a little bit

1168
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:35,615
Beyond the Hello World Component

1169
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:42,015
But it is there and it actually does work very well it's just that you will need to do some

1170
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:47,903
home work in tutorials and so forth but we want the list greeting and so

1171
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:51,487
This list greeting gives us a few Snippets now

1172
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:57,887
Do know that the Snippets are really not always accurate because it's very difficult for me to always

1173
01:01:58,143 --> 01:02:04,287
know exactly how the implementation is gonna work out so I'm giving you a snippet which is how

1174
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,687
I expect you to use the data but you can adjust that and this is where your knowledge of PHP will really

1175
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
come into play you should know that this and that little arrow

1176
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:23,487
Items is because we are working with an object and the you know what is it

1177
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:29,887
Mean and how to use an object and how to interact with an object

1178
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
How to parse over it, how to grab its values, how to update its values, all this is part of your

1179
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:43,199
own background that you need to bring to JCB.  JCB is not gonna

1180
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:49,599
At this stage crank out customized site views the way

1181
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:55,999
it does the admin views because my idea was it when it comes to site views I always wanna do

1182
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:02,399
Something different and I just want to have the ease of getting all the data on the page and then be creative

1183
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
And so I haven't spent much time to make this as automatic as I want to set up of

1184
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:15,199
the back end and the admin views because this is really what makes your component different from every other

1185
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:21,599
Component out there and here we want to encourage you to really

1186
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:27,999
Yes do you do a lot of preparation and thinking about data

1187
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:34,399
Structures in relationships because your Dynamic get can grab from so many data places

1188
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:40,799
And bring all that data to you in a nice object which you can then parse and display

1189
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:47,199
With a lot of permissional switches as I will show you in a moment so that is giving you little backdrop

1190
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:53,599
on why the dynamic get and the site view even the custom admin view , it's relationship

1191
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,695
and why it is like that ok so

1192
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:04,351
Basically looping through those items is this these two strings is all we need and then

1193
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:09,727
I could grab a listview let's see

1194
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:13,823
We are busy working on adding the

1195
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,895
Bootstrap library to JCB

1196
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,223
At the moment with basically got

1197
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,527
UI kit version 2

1198
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,087
Linked to JCB

1199
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:31,231
And I've selected the list option for this

1200
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:36,351
Uikit is a library developed by YOOtheme

1201
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:41,983
If you do not know UiKit I would encourage you to actually go

1202
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Google that

1203
01:04:43,519 --> 01:04:44,031
And

1204
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
Then

1205
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:52,223
You'll see it's quite a nice library to use we have voted that Bootstrap is the better one

1206
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,783
And so we are migrating to Bootstrap

1207
01:04:55,295 --> 01:05:01,439
But will still support UiKit as much as we can so for now just to get things going

1208
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:07,839
We simply gonna loop over the items show the name nothing is yet

1209
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:14,239
Clickable nothing is editable is just to get you know you introduced to using

1210
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
site Views

1211
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:17,055
Save and close

1212
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,407
Now we gonna go back to our component

1213
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:26,015
And we are gonna add the site view to it

1214
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:34,719
You might ask why don't we just add the component to the site view when we create the site view

1215
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:37,535
And that was a idea that

1216
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:43,935
You know I did play with but because of database relationships and all kinds of

1217
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,775
Reasons I felt that the better approach would be to link site views

1218
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
At admin

1219
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:53,151
At the component area instead of at the site area

1220
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:58,783
This gives us the option to use site views quite easily with in other components

1221
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:01,343
That was really the idea behind it

1222
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:07,743
We might rethink this and we might reshuffle this in the future I mean this is the first time I build

1223
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:14,143
Such a component called JCB and who knows what happens if we start refactoring it and a far more

1224
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:20,543
Advancement program is get involved it might become even far better than it is now

1225
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:23,359
Now but this is how it works at the moment

1226
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,151
So you go to site views

1227
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,223
And you click create link site views

1228
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:36,927
And then you basically select that greeting site view you say yes

1229
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:43,327
I want to have an admin menu sorry be able to add a menu to the front of my website with this view

1230
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:49,727
 I want this view to use Metadata this is going to be this component default

1231
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:56,127
View I wanted to control Access will look at

1232
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:02,527
That again but I want that access to that it's default be public so this is

1233
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:08,927
Basically again making use of all the options and save and close

1234
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:15,071
So now if we go back to compiling our component

1235
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:25,311
There's no changes being done to the database I need to maybe just give you a heads up here if you're

1236
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:31,711
Adding new tables JCB is

1237
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:38,111
Build to actually know that and add the tables to a

1238
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:44,511
Sequel update which when you update the component it automatically updates the data base

1239
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,119
But it's still important for you to actually check that it does this

1240
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,471
For there could be a reason that it thinks that it's not necessary

1241
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,007
Yet

1242
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,543
I tried to

1243
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,847
Most

1244
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:05,247
 I've tried to build enough places things in place so that it will actually pick up that you've add it 

1245
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:11,647
either a field or a new View to the component and that the component now needs to increment a version

1246
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:18,047
And Release a table update but sometimes that is not happening and

1247
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:23,423
And then even if you update your component the database is not being updated

1248
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
Necessarily

1249
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:31,103
So that's just something you need to keep your finger on make sure that that happens

1250
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,895
for most part

1251
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,943
JCB will take care of that

1252
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,343
And since now and this upgrade we have only added a front end we haven't touch the data base

1253
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:47,743
Everything about that is just the way it was before so we can without any concerns just compile

1254
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,535
And

1255
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:52,095
Re-install the component

1256
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,887
And then go and add it

1257
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,911
To the front

1258
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:58,239
So we can sort a look at what has happened

1259
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,775
Ok

1260
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:04,383
Now just a heads up

1261
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:10,783
When you add a front end site view and you said that it's default should be public

1262
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:17,183
But if it's not the first time you installed the component then that default cannot be set to the database because

1263
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:23,583
It's a default that only gets set the first time the component gets installed, I don't wanna go into all

1264
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
All the technical reasons for that but you could go into the app the components script file and you can search through it

1265
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:36,383
To see what I mean because it's actually a function that gets added to the script file and only gets implemented

1266
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:42,783
 with on the first installation of the component now that's important then if you do not

1267
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:49,183
Even follow what I was saying now and why I said it then I hope you'll get to

1268
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:52,767
To understand it as I try and demonstrate these things

1269
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:59,423
Before you can add the greetings to a site admin sorry to a site menu let's

1270
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,727
 just at least add a few greetings

1271
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Ok

1272
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:17,599
So we've got at least four greetings in place and now we can actually add

1273
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,647
That list View to an

1274
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,439
Front and site view

1275
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,487
So we go to menus

1276
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
And

1277
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
Go to main menu

1278
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,727
Select menu type click Hello World greetings

1279
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,103
that was the previous component

1280
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
Ok

1281
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,431
Everything else looks good

1282
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:46,783
So we've got Greeting set as the home

1283
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
Of this website

1284
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,111
And we gonna click save and close

1285
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,975
There we go

1286
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,559
But got home and Hello World greetings

1287
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,143
That should mean that if we click on

1288
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,167
This

1289
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,447
Preview

1290
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
The front end of the site

1291
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,287
We should see the greetings

1292
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:13,407
It's gotta say the page isn't redirecting properly

1293
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,223
And the reason is like I explained

1294
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:20,319
We set the front side view

1295
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,135
That it should have access control

1296
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,671
Which means

1297
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:31,071
You can control who sees this page not that it's just open to everyone but

1298
01:11:31,327 --> 01:11:34,911
But you can say only this group can see it all only that group can see it

1299
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,471
But since we haven't set that

1300
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
And by Default

1301
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,311
Doesn't allow anyone

1302
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:46,431
Now we said that it's by Default should be public but like I explained

1303
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
But I

1304
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,735
Gave you that heads Up

1305
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:55,647
It only sets that default the first time the component is installed so it is the way you should ship the

1306
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:56,415
Component

1307
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:59,487
If you only add that feature later

1308
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:03,071
You need to do custom scripting in the script area

1309
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:06,655
Which is the beyond Hello World component tutorial

1310
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:12,543
To update a database and ensure that this view is actually public

1311
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:17,919
The manual way to do this is basically to go to the Hello World component

1312
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:20,223
Click on options

1313
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,783
Then go to permissions

1314
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
Scroll down

1315
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:28,159
To the area where you see greetings site access

1316
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,463
Select the public group

1317
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,511
And change

1318
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,559
This site access

1319
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,839
To allow

1320
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,983
This will now ensure that the site area is actually

1321
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,775
Available

1322
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:45,823
To the public

1323
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,663
So having refreshed the

1324
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:54,015
Public area we know see James Williams Sarah and Koos

1325
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,807
All of them loading

1326
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
As expected

1327
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:00,159
Ok now

1328
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,439
Let's

1329
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,975
Add a

1330
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:08,863
Link to James so that when you click it you actually see the greeting that James should receive

1331
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:16,031
So we go back to the site views and we open the greetings

1332
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
Now we wanna add a link here

1333
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:23,455
But there is a better way of doing a link in JCB

1334
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:26,527
Which really takes care of all the

1335
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,831
Controller issues

1336
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:34,463
When I go to the front end of the component then we open

1337
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,023
The model for greetings

1338
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,607
Will see that there is the get items method

1339
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,423
And in it we are basically checking

1340
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:45,983
Whether this item has an alias

1341
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,311
If it does have an alias and an ID

1342
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,639
It actually creates what is known as a slug

1343
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:55,455
And this alias

1344
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
And id gets combined

1345
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,295
Into The Slug

1346
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:04,927
Since we know that our greetings area does not have an alias

1347
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:06,975
In fact it only has an ID

1348
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,791
It will only end up with an ID in The Slug

1349
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
So

1350
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:13,375
Let's go add an alias

1351
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,703
to hour greeting

1352
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:20,031
There is a shortcut to the site

1353
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:24,639
Sorry the fields linked to an admin area it's this little icon here

1354
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:28,479
And we basically wanna add another field called alias

1355
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:30,527
And if you go to the fields

1356
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,831
We'll see that there

1357
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,391
Is already a field called alias

1358
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,695
So we can simply use that field

1359
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,279
So go back to the admin views

1360
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:45,631
And we'll click on this shortcut for

1361
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,167
Adding fields

1362
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:50,239
And

1363
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,263
We gonna

1364
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
Basically

1365
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:55,103
Click here and add an alias

1366
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,687
We gonna tell the system that this isn't alias

1367
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,223
And

1368
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,271
Now we are moving

1369
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:05,599
Both of these above the tabs

1370
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:10,207
And we are creating the alias to be second in line

1371
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,487
And the greeting

1372
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:13,535
We are going to

1373
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,095
Let's see

1374
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,887
Make it a full width

1375
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,423
The greeting

1376
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,983
We also gonna go edit the greeting

1377
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:23,007
In a moment

1378
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:26,847
So that it's no longer a text field but a text area

1379
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:32,735
Ok so we got name alias all of that is in place save and close

1380
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,087
Going back to fields

1381
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,903
I'm going to open the greeting

1382
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:46,047
And since there are some values I want to stay the same

1383
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,119
I am going to select

1384
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
That

1385
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,191
XML

1386
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
Definition

1387
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,775
And I'm going to copy it

1388
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,847
Then I'm gonna select

1389
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:01,407
Textarea

1390
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,735
Then I'm gonna paste

1391
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,015
That first

1392
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,063
XML in here

1393
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:10,111
We obviously have to remove it again

1394
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,159
But just so I can copy paste

1395
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,207
Cut the name

1396
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,743
I want to keep the same name

1397
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:20,607
You can't just change the type because the type up here

1398
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:24,703
Needs to actually correspond with the type here

1399
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,775
So just changing the type in there will not work

1400
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,967
So the label you want to keep that the same

1401
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,783
We want to add

1402
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
Let's see

1403
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,183
Add greetings as a description

1404
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,607
We don't want to default text

1405
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,519
And let's add the hint back again

1406
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:11,295
We Don't really need any of these other Fields so we can just remove them

1407
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:14,111
We don't want the filter to be set to raw

1408
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,183
Would rather use the word string

1409
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:21,535
Since we don't want any HTML at this stage in our greeting

1410
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,887
If you want HTML now in the greeting you can use

1411
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,167
The

1412
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:34,847
Save HTML I see it's not in this list but it actually does exist

1413
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:41,503
Usually we would use the editor instead of just a text area

1414
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:42,783
Anyway

1415
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,063
So here we go

1416
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,087
We got

1417
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:47,135
Our textarea replace

1418
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,951
And I'm gonna add just here

1419
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:55,071
Span 12 I don't know how long that's gonna still be there as a class

1420
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,863
But I think it is still there

1421
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,935
And now I think that should do it

1422
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:03,519
Yeah let's change this

1423
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:07,103
No you know what we don't need to change that

1424
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:09,919
Save and close

1425
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:15,807
Ok since we didn't change any of the database values with this text field

1426
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:17,599
We shouldn't have any issues

1427
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,927
But we did add a new text field

1428
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,231
So if we go to the comp I

1429
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,255
Compiler

1430
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,303
And we compile the components

1431
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:36,031
You see that a dynamically incremented the version and

1432
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:42,431
If we go without installing we go to the component you see that it hasn't

1433
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:48,831
Actually updated view because this was open so before doing anything I would

1434
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:55,231
Suggest reopening the view basically refresh the page

1435
01:18:55,487 --> 01:19:00,351
So that the changes we also basically show

1436
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:08,031
So now we can go back in simply install the new changes

1437
01:19:08,287 --> 01:19:14,431
And if we go to a Hello World we should be able to

1438
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:20,831
Open the Hello World and we should see the alias there and if we click save

1439
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:27,231
It should dynamically add a new alias now we'll have 

1440
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:33,631
To do this for every item because the aliases are saved or created only once you saved the

1441
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:40,031
Item so I'm just opening all of them quickly now usually a user using your component

1442
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:46,431
You only gonna ship this component when you've got everything in place I hope and so they wouldn't

1443
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:52,831
have to do all this gymnastics to make sure that all the values are in place and if by some reason

1444
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:57,439
They have to you will have to help them along with some custom scripting I suppose

1445
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,719
Anyway

1446
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:01,279
So now that we got all our items set

1447
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,327
And it actually has an alias

1448
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,631
We can start working on those links

1449
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,727
There's one more place we need to make a change

1450
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,775
And that is in the dynamic Get

1451
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,336
If you remember when we set it up

1452
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,872
We didn't actually

1453
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Include

1454
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:18,432
The alias

1455
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,736
So I'm gonna copy this

1456
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,576
I then just change to just another

1457
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:27,136
View quickly and then back to this one

1458
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,952
So that we can get the alias there

1459
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,768
So here is the alias that we want

1460
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,560
We don't need all these

1461
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,632
And we can just add that over there

1462
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:41,472
There we go we got the alias now also selected

1463
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,520
Save and close

1464
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,592
So

1465
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:49,664
We can check with this alias is actually being

1466
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,968
Brought to the page

1467
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
By

1468
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,296
Adding a little

1469
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088
I call it

1470
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,648
production tricks

1471
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:00,928
So

1472
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:03,232
Would we'll do a little PHP dump here

1473
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,000
var

1474
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,072
dump

1475
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:12,448
And

1476
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:14,496
We just take all the items

1477
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:17,568
Copy

1478
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,872
Paste it in there

1479
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,688
and save

1480
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,016
Now we go back to the compiler

1481
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:28,064
I'm just quickly compile this again

1482
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,584
And

1483
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,120
Install

1484
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
Go to the homepage

1485
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,216
Refresh

1486
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:51,360
And now you will see that it dumps all the values on the page and then displace them

1487
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:53,920
So now we can look and see ok well fine

1488
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:58,272
There's the alias and actually created that Slug we spoke about

1489
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:03,904
So we got the slug for every item and that is the first step in setting up

1490
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,672
Hey

1491
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,952
Well-formed

1492
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,768
Link

1493
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:09,792
for

1494
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,584
Opening one of these items

1495
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,168
I don't know what Some of you might think

1496
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,240
Wow that's got a lot of things to do to get this to work

1497
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:23,360
But I can tell you if you wanna build components for Joomla

1498
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,920
And you wanna go outside of the box

1499
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:31,040
And build things that are actually unique and completely different from what other

1500
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,320
People are doing

1501
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:35,136
And this is really just the basics

1502
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:37,440
Ok so we gonna

1503
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,488
Set up a href here

1504
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,512
Around

1505
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,560
This name

1506
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:48,704
But we are gonna use PHP to basically take care of creating a link for us

1507
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:51,776
So here we are simply gonna say

1508
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:52,800
Echo

1509
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,384
And I'm gonna go show you where we get the name

1510
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,456
The class name for what we wanna do here

1511
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,600
I guess back in the code

1512
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,648
You see that there is

1513
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:09,440
In the helper class

1514
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
A 

1515
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:14,560
File called router so you can open that

1516
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:21,216
And you'll see that you have what is know now called Hello World helper route

1517
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
And

1518
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,824
If you scroll down

1519
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:33,248
We don't have this stage have how yes we haven't added the the site view for the single record

1520
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:37,856
So there are some values missing here oh man I should have first done that

1521
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:42,464
Anyway I'll go do that now but we'll come back to this file

1522
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:44,512
And there is another file

1523
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:46,304
Or I should say class

1524
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,608
that works together with this class

1525
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,936
And it's basically these two classes with their methods

1526
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:55,520
That we were gonna use to actually build our link

1527
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,568
Ok so let's

1528
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:58,848
Create

1529
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:01,152
That display site view

1530
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,688
So

1531
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:04,736
I've removed the

1532
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,040
var dump from this view

1533
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,344
I'm just gonna save and close this

1534
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,648
I could have set save a new

1535
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,928
Just gonna create

1536
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,464
Another site View

1537
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,304
And we gonna call this

1538
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,328
Greet

1539
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:23,168
We can't call it greeting because like we said

1540
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,496
There is already a greeting in the front

1541
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,128
All greeted that one might be better

1542
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,456
We gonna

1543
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,760
Make a nice display here

1544
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,552
I'm using

1545
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,344
Panel

1546
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,392
I'm gonna copy the panel snippet

1547
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
and paste it in here

1548
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:48,256
And the title

1549
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,536
I'm gonna make

1550
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,328
The name

1551
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,168
And the content

1552
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,960
Will obviously be the greeting

1553
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
Now I don't want two of those

1554
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,432
So I'm gonna take out this one

1555
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,784
So I basically

1556
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:13,088
Got one greeting setup here

1557
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:17,952
It's not yet gonna be oh you know there's no buttons here yet to edit it

1558
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,512
But he will basically view One

1559
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:21,536
Greeting

1560
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,608
And it will also show you who set up the greeting

1561
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:27,680
And ok now we can close this

1562
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,288
So we got this greeted

1563
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,824
Site view

1564
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:36,640
We can help go to the admin area

1565
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,664
Of the

1566
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,480
Good because sorry to Joomla component area

1567
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:42,784
And I'm gonna click on here

1568
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,064
And

1569
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:46,112
Actually add a site view

1570
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,416
To the component

1571
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,464
Same way we did before

1572
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,512
Can I say I want greet

1573
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,840
I don't want it to have an add menu

1574
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:58,400
It must have meta

1575
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:03,264
It's not a default view I also want access there

1576
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,568
And by Default it's not public

1577
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:06,848
So

1578
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:07,872
Save and close

1579
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:17,600
Now we'll compile the component again

1580
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:23,744
Ok I've compiled and installed it

1581
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
If we now go back to the that file I just

1582
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,864
Opened previously this Hello World

1583
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,656
Helper route

1584
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,704
And we scroll down

1585
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:36,288
Will see that now has a method called greet route

1586
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,128
And you basically pass it and ID

1587
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,920
And it constructs

1588
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
The

1589
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,736
The URL for you

1590
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Now

1591
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:49,600
This component view doesn't have category

1592
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,648
So it will skip this area

1593
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
But it's

1594
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,952
A function that I

1595
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,488
Wrote that should

1596
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,024
Be able to

1597
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,048
Basically

1598
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,840
Work for any View

1599
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:02,400
So

1600
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:04,704
You want to use this

1601
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,240
Method

1602
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,800
And this abstract class

1603
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
Now

1604
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,616
Those of you that are

1605
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:14,432
A little bit interested in how this works

1606
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,504
You'll see in the main

1607
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:22,112
File of the site View

1608
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:24,672
You'll see that the router

1609
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:27,744
Is actually also added as a helper class

1610
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:28,768
And

1611
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:33,120
This is basically the name of this helper class Hello World

1612
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:34,656
Helper route

1613
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:35,936
And so

1614
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,984
That's the abstract class name

1615
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:41,824
Going back to our site view of greetings

1616
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,360
To add our link

1617
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,432
We now know

1618
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,968
The method name

1619
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,016
So that's the method name

1620
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:52,064
And that's abstract class

1621
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:55,392
Sorry that's the class name now let's get the method name

1622
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,440
So we go back to

1623
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,584
Scroll down

1624
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:05,632
That's the method name so we can

1625
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,656
Just copy it

1626
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,448
It obviously

1627
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,728
Needs to

1628
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:14,592
Be corresponding to the view we want to open

1629
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,640
And we wanna give it

1630
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:17,920
The

1631
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:27,904
Slug so it's gonna be a item

1632
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
Slug

1633
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:36,096
But that's not the only function

1634
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:40,448
That we want to call here there is another one I mentioned

1635
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,544
Which works alongside this and it's called the JRoute

1636
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,568
Function

1637
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:47,872
Actually class I should say

1638
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:51,712
So we would add the JRoute around this

1639
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
First

1640
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,040
method class

1641
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,064
And

1642
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,112
That would basically

1643
01:28:58,624 --> 01:28:59,392
Add the

1644
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:01,696
Other values to the URL

1645
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,232
That is required

1646
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:07,328
Ok so we've got our own helper class of a component

1647
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,376
We give it The Slug

1648
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,936
Which then gives it to the

1649
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,216
JRouter

1650
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,496
Which then

1651
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:15,776
Echos out

1652
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,800
The link

1653
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,848
To open this item

1654
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,384
Great

1655
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,200
Now let's save this and compile again

1656
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,248
To see it in action

1657
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,952
We go to the front and

1658
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,744
Reload the page

1659
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,328
And when we click on one of these says not authorised

1660
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,352
To view greet

1661
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
That means

1662
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,192
This specific group

1663
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,752
Are not allowed to look at this

1664
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:51,360
What are ways to prevent the link from showing up in the first place

1665
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:55,968
But this is you for some reason you didn't actually put that custom script

1666
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
in place

1667
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:58,016
You see

1668
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:02,368
You can actually see how the backend generates some of this

1669
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,672
So if I go into the code

1670
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,744
And we go to the admin area

1671
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Of

1672
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
The

1673
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,352
Hello World component

1674
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:17,472
And we open the model

1675
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,824
And we opened greetings

1676
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,664
No no no it sorry not the model

1677
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,736
Actually the view and then greetings

1678
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,576
And we open the body

1679
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:35,136
And we open the view data HTML

1680
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:38,208
You'll see that it is grabbing

1681
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:42,048
Some permissions to know whether it should show certain buttons

1682
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:43,584
And then here

1683
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,400
Is again setting up some permissions

1684
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
To see whether

1685
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,984
You are allowed

1686
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,520
To actually

1687
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,056
Edit

1688
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,104
Here it is

1689
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,176
To actually edited the The greeting

1690
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,224
And if you're not allowed to edit it

1691
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,016
It just Echoes the name

1692
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,808
You see it doesn't show you the link

1693
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,856
So this area here

1694
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:10,720
Is really a demonstration of what you wanna do in the front

1695
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,024
You don't wanna always show the link

1696
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,816
To the item unless

1697
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:16,096
The person

1698
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:18,144
Who is actually viewing the site

1699
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,936
Is in the correct group

1700
01:31:20,192 --> 01:31:20,960
Of the site

1701
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,264
To be able to actually View

1702
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,288
The item

1703
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:27,616
Now I'm not gonna spend more time on this

1704
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,944
Part because we wanna also do an editing concept

1705
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:31,968
Which is really

1706
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:36,576
More interesting and what I would rather spend time on

1707
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:39,392
So here I'm just gonna go back into the admin View

1708
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,928
In the admin area

1709
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:46,048
And just change the permissions that the actual public could still open this view for now

1710
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:50,400
So in the backend I go to options of the

1711
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
Hello World component

1712
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,216
Permissions

1713
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,496
Scroll down

1714
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:58,080
Again I'll see there is a new one called greet

1715
01:31:58,336 --> 01:32:02,176
Change this to allowed for the public group

1716
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:04,736
And save and close out of there

1717
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:07,552
Now I forgot back to the front

1718
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,624
And click on

1719
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:11,904
This link

1720
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,952
It actually opens it

1721
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:18,816
And it gives us the name James gives us the welcome welcome to JCB

1722
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,632
And the greetings were set by the Superuser

1723
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,472
OK so it actually loads it as we expected

1724
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,264
You can also see in the

1725
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:31,360
URL this demo site of mine isn't fully

1726
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:33,920
Search engine friendly setup

1727
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:36,992
But it already generates that this is a greet

1728
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,272
To James

1729
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,040
And so

1730
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:43,392
And the name James appears here because of the Slug

1731
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:49,792
The Slug is used to generate the search engine optimisation here

1732
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:54,144
If we didn't have an alias it would have given you one or two

1733
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,936
Depending on the item ID

1734
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,984
Ok so

1735
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:00,544
That just gives you a quick demonstration

1736
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,592
Of how to set up

1737
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,872
A front-end

1738
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,456
That actually can open specific items

1739
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,992
Now The Next Step

1740
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:13,600
Is to actually make these items editable

1741
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,648
Now like I explain to you

1742
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,232
In the admin area we're ready doing some of this

1743
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,840
So I'm gonna just basically copy and paste most of the code

1744
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:25,376
From the admin area

1745
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,936
And I would encourage you to do the same

1746
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:33,568
Unless you know enough that you can just do it without looking at how JCB did it

1747
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,664
So I'm gonna copy

1748
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,712
The string

1749
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,088
And then I'm going to also

1750
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:47,904
Copy this one

1751
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,976
These few lines

1752
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:54,816
And then I'm also gonna use some of these

1753
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:01,728
I realize by looking at this first area that the Checkout

1754
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,520
And

1755
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,848
This Checkout value

1756
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,152
Needs to be set on the page

1757
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,712
I also need to make sure about this value

1758
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,992
Because

1759
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,296
We need to check the users authority

1760
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:18,880
On the page so we need to check whether the user is set

1761
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,160
On the page

1762
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:21,440
So

1763
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:25,024
We can go and do that and look at some code

1764
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:27,328
I'm gonna move some of this code

1765
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:31,168
And then we'll go to the front end of the code area

1766
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:34,752
I want to add the option to edit the item

1767
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,824
In both the list as well as the Single View

1768
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:42,944
So I'm gonna do it in the list view first and that I'll demonstrate step-by-step

1769
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:47,808
And then when we go to the Single View I'm just gonna place the code in place

1770
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,904
I'm not gonna explain to much because it's basically the same

1771
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,232
So here in the site view

1772
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:59,072
Of the list area I'm going to PHP and I'm going to

1773
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:01,120
Custom view script

1774
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:05,216
It says add PHP script to the head of the file

1775
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,008
So I'm gonna paste

1776
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:11,104
This link in here and we see that it basically

1777
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,640
Has this view

1778
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:13,664
Greetings

1779
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,480
And the task is greeting

1780
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:17,760
Edit

1781
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
So that is the task

1782
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:23,904
And it's gonna be available in the edit

1783
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:25,440
Variable

1784
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:29,280
Ok so that's the first part of the code we want up on the page

1785
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,584
Now for the rest of it

1786
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,632
We go back to the Admin view again

1787
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
The backend

1788
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:38,496
And we see wither we need to grab

1789
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,288
These as well

1790
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
So

1791
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,848
Before grabbing them

1792
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:47,712
Let's open the corresponding site view so we can look at some of the code

1793
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,016
Ok so

1794
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:54,112
Here is the greetings

1795
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,976
I'm gonna open this view HTML

1796
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:05,632
And we'll see that the user is already being loaded onto the page so we've really got the user

1797
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,912
That's great

1798
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,472
This is the items

1799
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:13,056
Ok let's look at this

1800
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:18,176
It is always is good for you to actually go and look at the code

1801
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:21,504
The JCB is writing seeing the code

1802
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,832
Is what makes you familiar with how things work

1803
01:36:25,344 --> 01:36:28,160
And also helps you to detect when something doesn't work

1804
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,440
Why

1805
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,720
And how to fix it

1806
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:35,072
Since we know that the user is on the page and we go to the site

1807
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:36,352
the admin area

1808
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,376
This area

1809
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:40,704
We see that it's accessing the user in the same way

1810
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,984
Using this

1811
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,264
As an object

1812
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,288
User

1813
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:46,592
And ask him whether it has authority

1814
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,872
On the core

1815
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
managed

1816
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,920
To check in

1817
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:53,248
And then also it

1818
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,296
Basically checks

1819
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:58,112
And gets the check out user

1820
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
Details

1821
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,160
And

1822
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,952
We'll see why in a moment

1823
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:05,536
But we don't have the check out user on the page

1824
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
So

1825
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,864
What we gonna do it's we gonna quickly

1826
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:12,192
Also get those values by going to the Dynamic Get

1827
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:15,776
And making sure that those values get brought to the page as well

1828
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,360
So we go to list greetings

1829
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:25,248
And again like before we just copy all those values

1830
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:29,088
And just tweak away and then back

1831
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:34,208
And the values we now want to make sure also comes along

1832
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,768
Is basically

1833
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:42,912
I see it's a value that it doesn't by itself add

1834
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:44,448
To the selection

1835
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:48,032
But you can add it in because you know it is in the database

1836
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,312
It's just that

1837
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,616
This table selection

1838
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:56,992
Only shows at this stage the actual values that

1839
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,576
That it knows belongs to the view

1840
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,184
I think I need to update this in JCB

1841
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:07,744
It is a little tweak which I haven't done

1842
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:12,096
So it's not showing the Checkout and Checkout by values

1843
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,656
But you can type it in by just going

1844
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:16,704
And then

1845
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,520
Those values will also be brought to the front

1846
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:21,312
Of this view

1847
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,592
So

1848
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,640
Basically the Checkout and

1849
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,176
The check out time

1850
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:29,504
Actually we don't need the check out time

1851
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:31,552
Only the check out

1852
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:33,344
Basically who checked it out

1853
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:36,160
We could add the time

1854
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:42,560
But I'm not gonna demonstrate that during this tutorial we'll really it was over an hour and so few minutes

1855
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:46,912
So I'm just gonna use the check out for now saving clothes

1856
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:51,264
So we've updated our Dynamic get

1857
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:56,384
And that means our values are on the page and we can move our code into place

1858
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,968
We'll need to add it inside of this for each loop

1859
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:01,760
Since this code

1860
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:04,832
Is actually working with the item

1861
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,856
Itself

1862
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,048
Ok so we've got the code in there

1863
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:16,096
Recalling the user

1864
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:20,960
We also checking the item check out to the user ID

1865
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,496
Making sure it's

1866
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:24,288
0

1867
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,616
We checking whether to check out user

1868
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:32,480
Now let's go get the rest of the code we need

1869
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:37,088
So again in the admin view we gonna go with

1870
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:39,136
This area here

1871
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,928
And just copy that

1872
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:48,608
We wanna make a few adaptations because in the end of the day

1873
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:52,448
The front end is a little different from the back end

1874
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,984
In that

1875
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:55,264
It is only

1876
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:03,712
The backend only displays an edit view the front-end also displays a read view

1877
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,480
So

1878
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,784
We wanna make it a little different

1879
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:14,976
You can pause the video to see some of the things I've done here

1880
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:21,376
But in simple terms I basically got the edit here I'm editing echoing the edit

1881
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144
Link

1882
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:28,800
And I'm adding the item and I'm putting in a little icon which then you can click

1883
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:32,128
And here I'm checking whether you have permission

1884
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:33,664
To actually edit

1885
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:39,552
This item so if we were save this and refresh the homepage

1886
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:45,952
It should actually not change anything because the public doesn't have permission to edit it at this stage

1887
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:50,560
Ok that icon should be pencil not edit

1888
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:54,656
Ok so let's save this and compile it

1889
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,704
to see it in action

1890
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,896
install it

1891
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:08,480
And we reload the home page

1892
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,552
and as you can see it doesn't show those little

1893
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,344
Buttons

1894
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,904
Now if we go to the back end

1895
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,976
And we go to options

1896
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,560
And we change

1897
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
That

1898
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:26,656
The public is allowed to edit

1899
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:29,728
And

1900
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,824
Let's say Let me not change state

1901
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:38,688
Yeah Let's just do that they aloud to edit

1902
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:42,016
And

1903
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:44,320
Let's open the front again

1904
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:47,904
We know see that it shows the edit

1905
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:49,440
Pencil

1906
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,744
Let's click on that

1907
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,048
And we see it opens

1908
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:56,096
The edit area

1909
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:58,400
Where it can actually now

1910
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,960
Add the exclamation

1911
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,496
And click on save

1912
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:06,080
Save and close

1913
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:10,432
It tells us that the message was saved successfully

1914
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,712
If we now

1915
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,760
Open that greeting

1916
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:16,064
We see that has the exclamation

1917
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,856
so our 

1918
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,672
Attempt to integrate

1919
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:24,000
Or to make our items editable

1920
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280
On the front end

1921
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:28,352
Within the control of permission groups

1922
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:31,936
Has actually worked very effectively if we again

1923
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,472
Revoke the permissions

1924
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,264
And

1925
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,056
Refresh the page

1926
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:39,872
And then suddenly those links are gone

1927
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,664
And even if somebody

1928
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,456
Were to try and

1929
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:45,760
Circumvent the system

1930
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,040
By having

1931
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,112
In the URL paste in the link

1932
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:53,696
To edit that specific item and

1933
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:54,976
It will actually

1934
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,768
Say that it's not permitted

1935
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
So the

1936
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:04,448
The the permissional structure is actually armed and will protect the item from being edited by

1937
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,216
By that group

1938
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,752
So

1939
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,800
Again we gave the

1940
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:09,568
Public

1941
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
Permission to edit

1942
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:13,664
But now the question is

1943
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:16,224
Can we also give it permission to create

1944
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:19,552
So going back to greetings

1945
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,856
Let's add an option to create

1946
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,624
An item

1947
01:43:23,392 --> 01:43:25,952
If I go and add this button here

1948
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:27,744
With

1949
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,512
a link

1950
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,560
To create an item

1951
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,376
But I'm not adding any checks around it

1952
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:36,448
But you basically need the same kind of

1953
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:39,264
Check as you've using here

1954
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:42,336
Except that there are some

1955
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:44,128
Shortcut let me

1956
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,176
Let me show you

1957
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:51,040
So basically around the button we added this PHP

1958
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:54,112
That checks the users authority to create

1959
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,648
For the core

1960
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,928
Of this component

1961
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,464
If yes

1962
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:02,560
Then it will show the button if no the button will not show

1963
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:06,912
So that is to control the visibility of the button

1964
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:10,496
So let's save this and then compile and install

1965
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:12,032
To see it in action

1966
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,392
So we see the button doesn't show

1967
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,696
And that is because currently

1968
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,488
Who got a component set

1969
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,256
That

1970
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:34,048
the public

1971
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,072
Cannot

1972
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,608
Actually create

1973
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:38,912
If we allow creating

1974
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:40,192
For the public

1975
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,472
And we

1976
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:43,264
Refresh the page

1977
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:46,592
You see that now it actually shows

1978
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,664
Sorry that's the different view

1979
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
It is this one

1980
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:52,480
Refresh this page

1981
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,504
There we go

1982
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:55,552
Now if we click on it

1983
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:59,392
It will open an area where we can create an item

1984
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:05,536
So here we can set a new name

1985
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:07,328
And then

1986
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,864
Save and close

1987
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:12,704
We get this save not permitted

1988
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:16,544
This must mean that we haven't granted enough permissions

1989
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,568
For the

1990
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:19,360
Public user

1991
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,896
To actually create an item

1992
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,224
See giving it the option to create an item

1993
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:27,040
Is not enough because there are fields

1994
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:27,808
That

1995
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:31,136
You know you need also access to

1996
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,928
Before you can create an item

1997
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:35,744
So let's let's try again

1998
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,792
But first giving it more permissions

1999
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,352
So we've granted it

2000
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:42,912
Basically all the permissions

2001
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,192
That it needs

2002
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,984
and go to the front

2003
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:49,312
Now we click create greeting

2004
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,872
Save and close

2005
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,920
And there we go

2006
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,456
With saved the item

2007
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:58,784
We can again edit the item

2008
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:00,832
We can close

2009
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,392
And we can View

2010
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:08,000
As you can see it's all working

2011
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,536
As expected

2012
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:11,840
So

2013
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:14,144
Our Hello World tutorial

2014
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:15,680
Is nearly at it's end

2015
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:20,288
We have within this tutorial demonstrated to you

2016
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,824
How to create

2017
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,384
A Hello World Component

2018
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:26,176
List its items

2019
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,992
Open individual items

2020
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,296
And edit those items

2021
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,368
As well as creating new items

2022
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,648
All based

2023
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:38,208
On the permissional of structures

2024
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,488
Of the component

2025
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:41,024
So if we

2026
01:46:41,280 --> 01:46:43,584
Where to change these permissions back

2027
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:45,120
To not allowed

2028
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:48,704
And we now refresh the front

2029
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:50,496
We'll see that

2030
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:52,544
Now we can only view the items

2031
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,592
And even more

2032
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:56,128
If we go back

2033
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:59,968
And we wanna control the actual viewing of the greet items

2034
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:05,600
Not be visible to the public but maybe only to let's say managers we could do that

2035
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,648
So you can manage

2036
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,976
That kind of control over your items

2037
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:13,792
You know without actually

2038
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,840
A lot of custom code

2039
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:19,936
If you click on it now it will tell you don't have authority to view it

2040
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:22,240
Now you can add

2041
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,776
Basically custom

2042
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,800
Scripting

2043
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:28,640
To remove the link so that it doesn't even look clickable

2044
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,712
If the person doesn't have access to view it

2045
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,272
But that's already

2046
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,320
We gone so far over the time

2047
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:38,624
Trying to demonstrate to you

2048
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:42,720
Some of the basic principles of setting up a Hello component

2049
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,256
In JCB

2050
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:47,840
I trust you've enjoyed this tutorial

2051
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:54,752
By far it doesn't usually take this long to actually build a Hello World component

2052
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,824
In fact there is a older tutorial

2053
01:47:58,336 --> 01:48:01,152
Where we managed to build a Hello World component and very

2054
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:02,432
Shorter time

2055
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:06,784
But I illustrated and demostrate it and explain it a little more here

2056
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:09,088
To help you guys along

2057
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,672
To actually build components with JCB

2058
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:15,232
And that you'd realize that JCB

2059
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:19,072
Is really actually a very powerful application

2060
01:48:19,584 --> 01:48:22,144
I mean I haven't even gone to the code this time

2061
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,448
And shown you all that it's written

2062
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:28,288
But I mean just from the compiler

2063
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,872
We ready got 13000 lines of code

2064
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:36,992
Which would have taken you 5 8 hour days to write

2065
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,784
Which is about

2066
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,856
39 hours

2067
01:48:42,368 --> 01:48:47,488
And I think for a basic component that's quite a lot of code

2068
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:52,864
And it's because that it's already integrating a lot of permissional structures and

2069
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,424
you know version control

2070
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,960
I mean if I was to

2071
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,984
Open

2072
01:48:58,240 --> 01:48:59,008
The greetings

2073
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,032
And

2074
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,848
Just open James

2075
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:04,640
remember we added that

2076
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
little

2077
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:10,272
Exclamation mark We could check the version

2078
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:12,832
We can see the changes and when it was made

2079
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:15,136
We can actually review

2080
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,184
Some of the previous versions

2081
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,744
And we can even go back to those versions

2082
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,560
That kind of integration

2083
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:27,680
With your history component is done automatically by just adding history

2084
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:30,240
And so is many of the other features

2085
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:35,360
The JCB is adding to your component like export of data import of data

2086
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:37,664
Bash sorry Batch

2087
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,712
Changes that you can make

2088
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:41,504
As well as

2089
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:45,088
You know a whole lot of other concepts

2090
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
Which

2091
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:49,440
It's just Beyond the scope of what we had time for today

2092
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:54,560
Well enjoy coding and yes

2093
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:56,352
If you have any issues

2094
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:57,888

Check the tutorials

2097
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:04,544
And if you just think you've discovered a bug

2098
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,848
You're most welcome to open an issue

2099
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:11,200
And we'll see what we can do in trying to resolve that for you

2100
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,528
We would like to invite other

So that

2109
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,144
It can become a home

2110

For us to manage

2111
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:35,008
The troubled waters of open-source

2112
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:36,544
Development
