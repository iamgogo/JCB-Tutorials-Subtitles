1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
I would like to talk about the expected or anticipated New Library feature that's being added to JCB

2
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,984
I'm still in the development phase of this

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,056
I've been working on the UI

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,920
Which really is just how I anticipate it should function

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:21,760
It's not yet set in stone

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:23,552
Because I have not yet started

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,392
Adapting the compiler to make use of the

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
This new feature

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,768
But it is anticipated to actually eventually

10
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Become

11
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,328
More fixed and

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,096
Steady

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,168
So I wanna basically illustrate

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
two things

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
one is

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,008
We have this Bootstrap library

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,104
Set up now This Bootstrap library the specific name here

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,128
Is linked

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
Too many many Snippets

20
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,992
And so it it can never change even

21
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,552
I've made it that even if you try to change it

22
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:56,576
Can you click save

23
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:01,184
You know it will actually revert back to the correct name

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,792
That's only with regards to libraries that already become part

25
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
Of the

26
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,608
Joomla

27
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,168
Component Boulder Community Snippets libraries

28
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,752
So Everytime We have new libraries contributed

29
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
To the community

30
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:18,848
Then

31
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,152
That library's name

32
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,432
Will become fixed

33
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
So It cannot be changed

34
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,600
And that a way of protecting the system from collapsing on itself

35
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,720
Because if people could just change these things in their own JCB

36
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Then

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,560
It could end up making so many confused

38
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:39,840
Results

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
Anyone

40
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,984
What they still can change is the way that the library is actually

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:46,752
Added to

42
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,776
Components

43
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:53,408
I currently I said it up that it basically links to this two URLs

44
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
And it has this always add

45
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
But that means

46
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:01,088
On every page where Bootstrap 4 is being used

47
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
It will always add

48
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:03,904
These

49
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Files

50
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:12,096
Now we might later see when Joomla 4 is released that there are some local Joomla 4

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,472
 libraries we would rather use like you have for jQuery at this stage

52
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:22,080
If you wanna use jQuery on a page you wouldn't do this kind of inclusion

53
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:27,712
You would rather use the internal Joomla API to get those libraries on the page

54
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,784
And for that I added this custom script option

55
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
there are two places where in every view there are two types of functions used

56
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
To add

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:40,768
The

58
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
Specific library to the page

59
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,888
The one function is this prepare document function

60
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
And the other one is set document

61
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,264
And the one function uses the document

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Directly

63
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
Variable naming

64
00:02:55,616 --> 00:03:00,224
And then add script because it actually adds document to the document variable

65
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:04,064
The other one grubs upon a global document variable

66
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
And it's really based on

67
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
Which class it is inheriting and so forth

68
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,512
So they are basically there for two methods

69
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:17,888
Being used to adding the custom or the library to any page

70
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
And so when you

71
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
Use this custom script option

72
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,496
You would

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,264
Target

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,592
These two functions or methods

75
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,872
Class methods

76
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,456
Which will then adequately be

77
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,480
available

78
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,504
For every

79
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,064
A page that makes use of this library

80
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,624
The other one is a conditional option

81
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
the conditional option is the better option really

82
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256
Because this one

83
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,560
Would actually adapt

84
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,096
The code

85
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,680
On the basis of the the implementation

86
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
per view

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
So here you would select the files that you have

88
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,432
and say whether it include or exclude You obviously if you select exclude

89
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,736
It means it will always include it

90
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:08,576
Unless these behaviours that you gonna set over here

91
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,624
Is actually you know

92
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,720
.

93
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,744
.

94
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
 valid

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,143
Now those of you who know the conditional concept within fields

96
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:25,471
This I just taken that same conditional concept

97
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
And I'm now just applying it on adding

98
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,567
Or not adding a file

99
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:34,175
So it's really very much the same so you still have this isolate or chain option

100
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,735
And the reality is you can now

101
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:42,111
There are no config Fields yet you need to first go here and create a config

102
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Field

103
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,951
Now config field is really an existing

104
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,255
Field that you've already created

105
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,559
Before coming here so

106
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
I haven't saved

107
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,911
This as a condition so I'm just gonna 

108
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
save that

109
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,775
And then I'm gonna go here to edit

110
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
And you'll see

111
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
The config library if I click on it here

112
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
I basically can select

113
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
Any field out of my

114
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,575
A whole list of fields so I've already made one just for our illustration

115
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,647
Bootstrap 4 Radio

116
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:16,671
And

117
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,743
That's really the field I wanted to be in the library tab

118
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,327
So this again is very much similar to the component

119
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,167
Config options area

120
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
except now we are selecting fields for the library which will then in effect be added to the components

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:34,847
Global

122
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Options area

123
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
Ok so let's save and close here

124
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:44,063
Now we'll see in this drop down that that field comes up here

125
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,343
If we selected

126
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
That fields have two options yes or no

127
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,207
So if this library and that

128
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
Library

129
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
File we wanna include it

130
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,863
When add Bootstrap button is set to

131
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:57,887
Yes

132
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,447
So here is a selection option

133
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:03,007
Now so that's the conditional way of doing

134
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,055
So basically at this stage we will have 

135
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,103
3 to 4

136
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
 ways of

137
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:12,223
Actually adding the the fields onto the page

138
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
The reason why this conditional one

139
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Is not being shipped

140
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
This way the moment

141
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
Because I'm not shipping these fields

142
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
And

143
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,231
The whole idea of

144
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:27,071
You know creating a field on all of those who

145
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
In all the systems of those who used JCB

146
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,239
 I'm still pondering whether I should write a script

147
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,263
To do that

148
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
So it's that's really the issue if

149
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,615
If we shipped this as the

150
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,943
The standard way of including the Bootstrap libraries

151
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:47,039
Then I will need to create this add Bootstrap version 4 field

152
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,831
On every system

153
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:51,647
And then link it in here with correct IDs ans stuff

154
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:53,695
And

155
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
So I haven't I haven't actually done that

156
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,023
Like I said

157
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,839
We are now looking at how can we do this

158
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,887
We wanna make this dynamic

159
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,447
Because now let's say someone

160
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
Has a specific

161
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
File

162
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,311
The day so let me just save this

163
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
 that specific file

164
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:11,871
Which

165
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:18,271
If if someone is using Bootstrap and they wanna add a specific extra feature and I need more

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,807
More JavaScript on the page

167
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,879
You know they could create that file

168
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Click here

169
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,975
By going to add new files

170
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
I know let's say it's a local file they could click here

171
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,351
And they can collect

172
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:34,399
Any file of just gonna make it

173
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Any file

174
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
And just like with a component include

175
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,847
When you add custom files to your component

176
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:46,943
You have that same feature really here except you can also use URLs

177
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:50,527
So it's the same custom adding of files or folders

178
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,343
So now you want to have this Bootstrap

179
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,903
Min.js

180
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
In the media

181
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:58,975
Boot

182
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,743
Strap

183
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
Bootstrap 4 there we go

184
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,375
You wanted in that folder

185
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
js

186
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,727
That's really where you want to put this file

187
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,311
And you don't want the file itself to be updated

188
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,615
that filename you wanna keep

189
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,943
And you want to have it available to the library

190
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
So now you click save and close

191
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,647
So now if we look here we'll see now there is a file called Bootstrap min.js

192
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,719
But you don't want to always be included

193
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
You wanted to be included only if there is a specific

194
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
Switch

195
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
Tripped

196
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,143
On on this

197
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,423
Use of this file

198
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,055
The idea is now that you would go to the config library

199
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
And you create a new field

200
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
And

201
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,247
Let's say that this new field is

202
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,831
Let's say I'm just gonna use a 

203
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Add more

204
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,415
And

205
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:04,511
Obviously it should be more related to Bootstrap but just for explanation

206
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,095
Then you would say that specific field which it

207
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Is this cases

208
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
It's this one

209
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
Should

210
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:15,007
When add more is set yes

211
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Then it should be

212
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
Added

213
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Now

214
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
That is as far as I've come to

215
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
Sort of

216
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Think about

217
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
Implementing

218
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,527
These kind of features

219
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
Dynamically

220
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,415
You see previously I wrote all this hard coded right into the compiler

221
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
And based on its own automated

222
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:39,327
Observation of the you know UIkit version 2

223
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,447
If it founds specific classes it dynamically added files or didn't add files

224
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Now

225
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
I'm thinking that

226
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,311
If you wanna be so

227
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:55,711
Customised and dynamic then you won't use the conditional option you'll rather use the custom script option

228
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
You still have these two buttons

229
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:00,063
That you can then use

230
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:02,367
The global

231
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Values of

232
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
You can still get those values

233
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,487
In the scripture

234
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
And act upon it and load in the libraries with custom scripting now I

235
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:15,423
I did some Prep on that kind of approached 

236
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,727
here in FooTable

237
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
It's actually

238
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Says here

239
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
This FooTable Style

240
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,151
So

241
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,943
You need to now

242
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
Actually line up a field value

243
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
With FooTable Style

244
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:34,111
And then it will dynamically add the specific

245
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
CSS classes

246
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
To the

247
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
to the table to the page

248
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
For both this prepared document

249
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,351
And for Set document

250
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
So you have

251
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:49,471
Add always then you have add conditions

252
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
Or custom script

253
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,079
Let me just say another thing about the condition option

254
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
The condition option

255
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,175
I'm pondering

256
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,759
Whether this condition option should have a global value

257
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,319
And also a page value

258
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
You see if it have a page value

259
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:10,463
Then you can overwrite the global value with the page value

260
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
So it's almost like if we detect

261
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
That let's say bootstrap 4

262
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
Is being used in a specific View

263
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
And that view has a menu

264
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,055
Then dynamically will add to that menu

265
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
The function of these buttons

266
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:33,503
As well as having it added up into the global options of the component itself

267
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,295
So it'll  be Global options

268
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,855
And the page will fall back on to the global options

269
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,999
Unless someone with manually overwrite that in the because when when is that usually the case

270
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:47,327
If they have another library or another component

271
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,375
That already loads the files

272
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
and they wanna excluded from the page because it's already there

273
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,287
And that's why I'm thinking about

274
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
You know having it on the page as well as globally

275
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:04,223
And if you feel well I don't want to use it to really decide whether these

276
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:04,991
You know

277
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,343
Libraries Should Ever Be on the page well then in that case add always

278
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
And then these files will

279
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,695
Including this one

280
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,743
Will always be added to the page

281
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
And we will take care of the script

282
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
The code to achieve that

283
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:23,167
And now I was also thinking if we

284
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,751
Wanna have some files only be added always then

285
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,079
Then it is the files that you do not actually

286
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
You know

287
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
If you want

288
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
For example if you want

289
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,015
These two files to be always added

290
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,879
Then within conditions you will only create a condition

291
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,951
For the files you want to have a condition for

292
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,303
So that the files that is not being targeted by conditions

293
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
Will automatically always be added

294
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Anyway

295
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,191
That is at this stage some of the thoughts I have

296
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
I'm thinking

297
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
I'm gonna

298
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
Say that if any of you wanna give more ideas

299
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,431
Then grab out your screen recorder

300
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,735
Open this page

301
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,319
And talk through and explain some things

302
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
In a little

303
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
tutorial

304
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,207
Post it on YouTube as a response to this tutorial

305
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:22,047
Or go to our GitHub discussion area

306
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
You know we are busy

307
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
with this

308
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
Discussion here

309
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,423
On GitHub

310
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
it's issue 92

311
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:29,983


312
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Bootstrap or

313
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:36,127
UIkit Version 3 or Bootstrap option

314
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
It's in this issue that this long discussion is going on

315
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:43,295
And where this whole library idea is actually

316
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,831
Forming and

317
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:48,671
Expanding you'll see already typed a little response here what I wanna post

318
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,999
With this tutorial that I'm making as a URL

319
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:53,791
So

320
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,863
Really what I would like to say is I'm busy

321
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,887
Trying to

322
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
Answer this new functionality

323
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
And

324
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,079
This is the way I've gone about doing it at this stage

325
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,359
And

326
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
I I know that these

327
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,295
Libraries that are already in our a component Bootstrap UI kit and fooTable

328
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,831
I'm gonna end up

329
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
Adding enough information for these libraries

330
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,695
So did they all just work out of the box

331
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
That's gonna be my responsibility to

332
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
To put all the necessary

333
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
Code and scripting and everything in place

334
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,935
So that this option will just work

335
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
All of them

336
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
And just when someone wants to expand on them

337
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,079
Will they need to do so

338
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,407
But it is obviously a once off situation

339
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:46,015
Once I've implemented this new feature and set these functions and

340
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
Properties in place

341
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:52,159
And people make adaptations to it I cannot update it again

342
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
And so having enough input

343
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
to think about all possible angles

344
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,655
And to approach this in a way that really makes it dynamic and really doesn't overcomplicate things

345
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,263
Is really what I'm trying to achieve although that seems difficult

346
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
Anyway

347
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
This is just a heads up tutorial

348
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,407
Looking at how to

349
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Use the new libraries area

350
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:21,087
And obviously if you want a specific functionality in Bootstrap 4

351
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,671
You cannot now create a new Bootstrap 4 library

352
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,511
With new files you need to expand on the existing one

353
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
And that's the whole point

354
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:35,423
We wanna make it that the existing library can be adapted and changed

355
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,215
An improved

356
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:44,127
At this stage that adaptation in those improvements will only be relevant to the one who's doing it

357
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,223
And so that might be something we were gonna think about

358
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
We gonna

359
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:55,391
you should talk about would we want everybody to share their adaptations

360
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:02,303
Or will we just set the stage with your regional adaptation and then whatever changes they make is up to them

361
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,887
Anyway this is a

362
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
Again a tutorial I just made

363
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
In the outset of this new functionality

364
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
Looking in asking please give me feedback

365
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
And let me know what you think

366
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
Thank you
