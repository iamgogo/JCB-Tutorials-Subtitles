1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,400
So we have a new feature in JCB version 2.9.

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
14

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
It's the latest release if you look at the release notes

4
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,896
Added the new placeholder area for Global

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:21,248
And component level placeholders now

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,112
Those of you did know did know that JCB already has a few placeholders

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,672
Which you can use across

8
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,440
The

9
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
System

10
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,792
If I have to show you those in the code

11
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,584
They are as follow

12
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:42,752
So once I've set of Place holders is the word component and this HHH is

13
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Basically

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
It is the same as

15
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,176
3 of those and then again on this side

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,480
Three of those

17
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,392
So three opening angle brackets and three closing angle brackets

18
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,976
That's what the hh the sorry no that's what the

19
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,256
bbb

20
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304
And a ddd stands for

21
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:10,656
Where is the hhh stands for hashes

22
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
one two 

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
three of those the side

24
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
And

25
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Three of those

26
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
This side

27
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,384
So those are placeholders that you know

28
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,944
Should know about already and gives you the

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
The possibility to

30
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
Add component name

31
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,856
lower case all

32
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:31,392
Uppercase First

33
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,416
Letter

34
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
All uppercase

35
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,512
And then with hashes as well as with

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Opening angle

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
Brackets enclosing angle brackets

38
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
So

39
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,704
That's the first set of placeholders which

40
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
You should know about already

41
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,032
If not

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
Then it's possibly

43
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
The truth that you haven't watched

44
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Previous tutorials

45
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Which I would encourage you to do the other set is basically the view

46
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Placeholder

47
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
The view has a few variations and it's not always available in every area depending on

48
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,048
What the

49
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,584
Area is

50
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,472
So for example in the backend the admin area It has view and views

51
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:18,752
For the list

52
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,872
And again you have this hashes and you have the open Square

53
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Braces

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,408
Bracket

55
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:27,712
And they closing Square brackets

56
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
And

57
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,648
Again all lowercase then one uppercase and then all uppercase

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,208
So it's variations of

59
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,232
View

60
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:44,608
Now the reason why you have the s at times is because there is

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
A list

62
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
View name

63
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
And then there is the

64
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
View name

65
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
As the edit View

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Single View name

67
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,592
And so

68
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:59,456
These place holders are also available but just when you are busy working

69
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
In the admin

70
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,040
Admin View area

71
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,320
So

72
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:07,392
With regards to the site View area

73
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,440
There is also a placeholder

74
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
Let me see if I can quickly find that here

75
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Ok here it is

76
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,704
So it has a capital S in front or a lower s

77
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
So

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:22,752
Again

79
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
It's because we don't have a

80
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
Different site view doesn't have a list view it can actually be a listview or it can be

81
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
A Single View

82
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
Based on the dynamic get

83
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,832
So that's why there isn't really

84
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:37,856
a difference

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
So

86
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,184
So we working with S View

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:47,584
Uppercase and lowercase all uppercase again with hashes and with braces again

88
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,728
We have this function to add the list option but you see

89
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
It is actually the exact same

90
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,336
Code so

91
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:01,152
If there by some reason is a

92
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:01,920
List

93
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
Implementation somewhere

94
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
It's really just replacing with

95
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
With the same code

96
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,624
So those are the custom Place holders or

97
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,904
What's the word

98
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,184
the core place holders

99
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
That already exist in the system

100
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
And

101
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,655
They already were taking JCB to a place where

102
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,751
We could achieve a lot of dynamic reusability

103
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,591
Of use of Fields and all sorts of

104
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Other implementations

105
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
But then came along

106
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,479
The idea

107
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:41,855
To actually be able to set our own place holders in the gooey

108
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,879
Of JCB

109
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:46,463
And to reuse them wherever we would like to

110
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,023
Just like custom code with behave accept

111
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
It's a string and not

112
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,143
A code snippet so

113
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,935
That's the major difference

114
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,031
And it also doesn't come with an IDE

115
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
Roundabout

116
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,103
Editing

117
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
Feature as custom code snippets do

118
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:10,271
It's just a in place replacement behaviour

119
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,807
So

120
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,391
Let's go back to the IDE to show you that

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,183
I mean

122
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
Not the ID the the gooey

123
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
JCB itself

124
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:25,631
So in JCB there is now a place called Place holders

125
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,167
And

126
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,959
You can open that up

127
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:33,311
And if you have imported some of my components you might have some values in

128
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
here already

129
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:36,383
If not it might have no values

130
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
So we still having these 3

131
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Open Square

132
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,551
Brackets and closing Square brackets

133
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:48,927
Surrounding our place holders if I was to create a new place holder

134
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,511
And type in any word

135
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
It it automatically adds

136
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,351
The

137
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,911
Brackets around the word

138
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:03,775
An immediately starts a surge all across JCB

139
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,335
To see if it's being used anywhere

140
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,663
If not obviously it tells you it's not being used

141
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:16,575
Now any word in this case I can add any type of string on this side

142
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:22,463
So as long as it is a one-liner string it can really be anything

143
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,743
It can have

144
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,327
Dollar sign in it it can have brackets in it

145
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,375
It can have multiple brackets in it

146
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,655
It can have

147
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,519
Even braces in it and again brackets and braces

148
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,847
And it can have dollar signs in well

149
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
It's supposed to

150
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,735
If you find something and it breaks stuff

151
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Let me know

152
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,367
in GitHub tell me about it it's a bug it's supposed to be able to

153
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,767
To handle any type of string now I've said all that now let's see if it actually does like clicking 

154
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
save here

155
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
Oh yeah

156
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
So it kept it exactly that way

157
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Now

158
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:09,055
That means where ever in my program I am you all let me just for safety add this as comment

159
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,103
So it's basically a comment string

160
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,783
It could have been a variable name it could have been another string now you might say why not just

161
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,319
Type that string

162
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
In that area

163
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
Well

164
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,743
You see JCB we are starting to embark upon

165
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
A idea

166
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:32,351
With I'm not sure how far it will go

167
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,423
Or how wide or broad it will expand

168
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:40,031
But it is the possibility of reusing code

169
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,127
From your custom code area in different components

170
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:46,175
In different views

171
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
This often requires

172
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,527
That certain little strings

173
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,551
Be different

174
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
But

175
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:59,487
There is a place where passing a string at from every component becomes very tedious

176
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:03,071
Because yes custom codes has this feature

177
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Where you can pass this string

178
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
To the

179
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,007
Code and then it updates that string in the code

180
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
But

181
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,871
There was this idea that we really don't want to be passing any string

182
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
And yet have a

183
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Automated

184
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,039
Updating string behaviour in custom code

185
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
So

186
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
This is where placeholders come in

187
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,183
So if I save and close out of this

188
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
I now have this new place holder any word

189
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
And I can now

190
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
Go to

191
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,119
A component

192
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
And let's say

193
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:42,751
I'm gonna take this anthropometry component as an example

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
And

195
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,871
I'm going to just add this place holder here like that

196
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
And

197
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,967
Save and close this is in the helper class

198
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
So I just added it to

199
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,831
anthropometry now I'm also gonna add it to this

200
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,391
Medical aid one

201
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,255
Again the same place order like that save and close

202
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:09,119
Now I know for this implementation what I'm showing you right now

203
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,167
It might not be that exciting

204
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,215
But I'm telling you if

205
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
You start to sort of

206
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Think about the

207
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,335
Greater implication

208
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
For example if we were to

209
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:23,199
Go to the dynamic code

210
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
And for example get method get member

211
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
This get member function oh wait I'm 

212
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:31,903
on the wrong place I'm talking custom code

213
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,487
Now let's say which one

214
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,047
I think I have

215
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,703
This little dot trick which is just a little JavaScript

216
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,007
That sort of runs and

217
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Populates a little dot

218
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:52,127
Tick tick tick tick tick showing like there's a progress

219
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
Just a little snippet

220
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,455
Now

221
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
It's being used quite a few places and

222
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
I might want to

223
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,463
use like for example

224
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,487
Let's say

225
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,143
Member profile I might be using member profile in more than one component

226
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
And

227
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Now

228
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
That means this specific

229
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
Site view the specific site view is being used in different components

230
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Now

231
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,783
If I want to have the code be different when used in

232
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,807
One component

233
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:37,695
Then used in another that's where placeholders really come in it's full strength

234
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:41,279
So if I was to place that snippet here any word

235
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,839
As an example

236
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
And save and close this

237
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:49,471
I now have in this little

238
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,871
Nice little dot trick I have a placeholder which will

239
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
Be replaced with

240
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,943
This value

241
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
But let's say

242
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,295
I instead

243
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
want to

244
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:10,463
Have it be different in one of the components that uses that little dot

245
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
Code snippet

246
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,047
I can go to that specific

247
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
Component

248
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
And I can add

249
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,423
That place holder here

250
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
And

251
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,751
Say not

252
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:23,775
Like

253
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,383
The other and now for this component

254
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
This place holder will be

255
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,015
Basically not like the other

256
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:39,135
So now you have a placeholder with within this component behaves differently

257
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,951
Then it does within other components

258
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,279
And that's really where placeholders

259
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
So let's compile this and see what happens

260
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
I have a few here so we got medical aid I'm gonna compile that let's see I don't have it installed

261
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
So I've have to first do coral

262
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,871
This is a project

263
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
Which we are planning to launch quite soon

264
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,503
I'm quite excited about this project

265
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:09,343
It's gonna be one of our proprietary projects

266
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
Ok so what's happened here oh yeah

267
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
We haven't set up the

268
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
The path ok just

269
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Put it in

270
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,191
Now so we gonna have to backup folder path setup now I can do anthropometry

271
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
And have it

272
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,335
Compile it's actually updating and placing all those

273
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,615
Placeholders and stuff

274
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,943
Ok so we gonna see the difference

275
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,551
And then I'm also going to add the medical aid one

276
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:42,879
Which is the one that doesn't have that overwrite

277
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,951
So it should use the global

278
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
Implementation

279
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,327
Ok so now with basically added

280
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,119
These two

281
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,679
Components to our

282
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
Joomla website

283
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,263
And

284
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
We have used placeholders

285
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
That actually Target

286
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
A specific any word

287
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,967
And we've placed that

288
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
In those components helper classes

289
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,111
And also within 1

290
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,159
Custom codes snippet

291
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,439
Called

292
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:20,511
Little nice little dot trick

293
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:26,911
Now to see in which of those components where there's little nice little dog trick is going to appear

294
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,031
It's basically gonna be in the member profile of Corel

295
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
So

296
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,383
Yeah that means we'll go look and see what it did

297
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,247
So first I'm going to open the helper class

298
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,783
Of coral

299
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,063
It's this one here

300
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,599
And then

301
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
Scroll down to that where that snippet should have been added

302
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,607
So in the anthropometry component it set not like the other because we added the overwrite

303
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
Then in the medical aid component it added those

304
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,775
That's very strange string A typed out

305
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,335
And in the coral component

306
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,127
Nice little dot trick

307
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
It also added that little

308
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:11,967
Snippet

309
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:16,831
Now to show you how easy it is to overwrite this again on a component level

310
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,623
Let me open this up

311
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,671
Let me go to the components

312
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
And

313
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
to Coral

314
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,607
An add a that snippet in here

315
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:30,655
And

316
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
That

317
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,263
Easy

318
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
Save and close

319
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
And then we compile that one again

320
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
Now we open the IDE again

321
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:52,159
And that easy

322
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
So

323
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,863
That is the power of placeholders it really replaces only from where the placeholder starts to where it ends.

324
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
It means you have the ability to change that little text to have the ability to

325
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Change

326
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,055
You know

327
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
This

328
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,383
Yes you actually able to

329
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,175
Change even the little dot 

330
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,455
You add a space

331
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,223
Or

332
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
I'm not sure about the

333
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
Space one

334
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
That might be over eager but

335
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:27,487
The reality is it's really powerful you're able to anywhere add a dynamic string

336
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,815
Which you then can overwrite on a component level

337
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:36,447
So yes I hope you find it very useful

338
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:42,335
Because I am finding it at this stage I have components that

339
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Actually

340
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
Run together or

341
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
How can I say

342
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:49,759
And all these components build on top of coral

343
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Coral

344
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,087
Itself is a

345
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Sort of

346
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:54,879
Central

347
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,951
Integration hub if you will

348
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,999
Where all these components

349
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:02,047
you know connect into

350
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:02,815
Coral

351
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,607
And create

352
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
Exciting kind of

353
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Interface

354
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
So that means I often need to rename certain values differently just based

355
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
On

356
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,407
The actual component

357
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,431
And

358
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:22,271
This way I'm able to have that kind of placeholder Power

359
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,855
And replacing it and have the same code snippet

360
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:32,255
Across these components but just because it's now in this component is actually being updated differently

361
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,071
Then it would in for example this one

362
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,143
And yeah they are even more

363
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Implementations

364
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,751
But I think this would be enough to get you going

365
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
and help you understand

366
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
Why we added placeholders

367
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:51,711
And where we think it will be able to

368
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,527
Take the JCB community

369
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
With

370
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,111
More creative abilities

371
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,647
Right inside

372
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,671
The 

373
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,719
The graphic interface

374
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
Of JCB

375
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,791
Well again

376
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,839
As always thank you for watching

377
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:13,215
Let me know if you have any questions either in the comments or on the Forum

378
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:14,495
You're most welcome.
