00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:06,400
I would like to demonstrate to you one of the latest features that's been added to JCB

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,984
If it's a request was made about 11 days ago

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,056
Auto generate my update SQL

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:16,128
After a lengthy discussion

6
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,944
the decision was made to add the

7
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:26,112
The future and I am basically done doing so first let me give you some 

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,416
Background so you can understand where we coming from

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,000
When you create a component in Joomla

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,144
Then usually you have a set of views and the views and the backend are linked to a set of tables

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,960
I'm so on the installation of the component

12
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:46,592
For example if we do so here with JCB

13
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
It actually

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,712
Builds the tables for those views on installation

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:55,552
So then if you go to the back end of the component

16
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:57,600
And

17
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:59,904
You create a new item

18
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,192
it actually stores the value in the database

19
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:15,520
So that it can be retrieved that's very basic

20
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,312
The reality is

21
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
If you as a developer make a change

22
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
To this component

23
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,712
Which involves new tables

24
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,992
Then

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,064
Obviously you would need to add

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,624
Extra script to your components package

27
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,928
So did upon installation

28
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:39,328
If it finds that there is already an existing component it will actually update the database accordingly to the

29
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,424
New settings the new tables or any Fields added or so forth

30
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
So we gonna demonstrate this

31
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:53,152
In JCB there used to be a way to do that which still works by the way it was

32
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,552
manual way a way for you to manually add the new SQL statements

33
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
That are needed to make the update, it was done under this version updates tab so you would click on a version 

34
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
Updates tab and here you would add your specific sequel

35
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,216
Query script and upon installation

36
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,032
If the existing version is below

37
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,712
This update it will grab this and install it into the database creating the new tables and so forth

38
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
So

39
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:34,880
What I'm gonna do now is you'll see that at the moment

40
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,720
This admin view has only 1 2 3 4 5 6

41
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
Views

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,072
I'm gonna add another View to this component

43
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,472
You can see it doesn't have these buttons ticked

44
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
I don't not know how to resolve this it seems like

45
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,592
This is a Joomla problem

46
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
Because there are multiple

47
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,456
Columns in this view

48
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
Because if you close it and click it again

49
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:08,160
And actually fixes that anyway that's just by the way so now here I'm gonna add a new

50
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,184
View

51
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,560
Called help documents and just make some minor changes to the defaults

52
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:16,864
Add it to the 7th position

53
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
And then click save and click save again

54
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,080
So now we basically add a new view which means a new table to the database

55
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:28,896
But we haven't written any of the SQL

56
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:35,296
Because with the new changes this is gonna be done for you automatically on the moment to compile this

57
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
Component

58
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,856
So let's do that

59
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
So now here we are, we are going again compile this component you see it's version is it still 

60
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
1.4.1

61
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
So

62
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:50,912
We are compiling it

63
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
Now what the system is doing is, it is checking the history and it's making a lot of calculation

64
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,176
To dynamically realise that there is been a new table increment

65
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,968
The version number

66
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
And

67
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,784
If I now

68
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
Install this component

69
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:13,696
And I go and open that component

70
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,839
I'll see that the new view is here if I open the view there is no errors

71
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
if I create new

72
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,031
 it'll automatically start behaving the way that is expected

73
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
And

74
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,383
That is really

75
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,431
Let say,

76
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
text

77
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,991
And then, hi

78
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
So we are targeting

79
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,831
The

80
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,623
External sources

81
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
So forgot

82
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
Few other things here

83
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:49,535
as you can see

84
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
The database already stores the values

85
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
And the new table is actually therefore in the database and working as expected now

86
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
 you realize that

87
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
This means that our

88
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,127
JCB component

89
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,199
Has been updated so if I refresh this page

90
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,855
You'll see that the version number has been incremented

91
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,999
And if you open the version updates and scroll down you would see that one point

92
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
.......

93
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,071
1.4 .1

94
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Got this new

95
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,423
creating of a help document

96
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
Table

97
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,775
And a new version got allocated here

98
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Obviously we do not know what is this link and so we add this demo link here which you need to manually update

99
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
 still

100
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,063
But that is by far a tremendous improvement

101
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,391
Ok this also works not only with

102
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:53,791
The adding of a new view but also if you were to add a field

103
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,911
To an existing view so let me demonstrate that quickly

104
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,007
So I'm gonna be adding a new field to the preacher View

105
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:07,871
I'm simply gonna select any Fields since I will removed again

106
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:09,663
Let's call it

107
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,599
Image

108
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,463
And I'm gonna add this to left

109
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
One

110
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,327
That must be then two

111
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,863
And save

112
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
And save and close

113
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,983
So now I've added a new field to preachers

114
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,567
And again I'll be going to the compiler

115
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
And I'll select the component and just compile

116
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:49,855
And again since it detected there's been a field change it incremented the version number

117
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
And if I install the component

118
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,975
And we go to the component

119
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,047
To the preachers View

120
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
We'll now see

121
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935
That new field actually there

122
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Image

123
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,519
And if I was to select an image

124
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
And save

125
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
You'll see that it

126
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
Really

127
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:19,807
Oops I see I actually missed it

128
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
The reason was that

129
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:29,279
This component didn't have any history so I had to go and make a few changes take into

130
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,631
account that your building a component from the ground up it will have history

131
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:38,751
So this is only gonna be happening when you have install a component

132
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:44,639
via the import function in the components or maybe using the demo component

133
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
So what I would advise it just open all the views and save them at least once so that there is history recorded for

134
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
For that View

135
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,463
That is one of the drawbacks there is really no way for me to my negate that issue

136
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
Since the history

137
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,583
Of each of these different items

138
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:09,983
Being at the admin view and the fields actually needs to be created the moment that you saved the item

139
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,799
And it's really can't be done before then

140
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Ok

141
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,871
So taking that an account

142
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
I'll recompile it again and fix

143
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,783
That so it should increment it to 1.4.3

144
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
I will just install that

145
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:26,879
Again

146
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,071
Going back to refreshing the preacher will see that

147
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,655
Image field is back

148
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,959
now select an image

149
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:45,823
Click save and now you'll see

150
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:49,407
That it actually does store the data for this image

151
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
Because if we refresh the

152
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,367
The component will see that it is again

153
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Incremented the version

154
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
If I open the

155
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:03,487
Update area

156
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,791
You see that it actually

157
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
Added this new

158
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:11,679
Altering of the preacher table adding the image

159
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Field

160
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
And it is also added the new

161
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,079
Version to this list

162
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:24,223
Ok so that is a quick demonstration of this new feature automated feature

163
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,295
It is in its very beta

164
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:29,855
Phase we obviously still gonna

165
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:33,439
Be working at it to make sure that it's completely stable

166
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,999
So please

167
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
Take a go at it if you find any bugs open look for other open issues which may be

168
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:45,215
Someone already reported

169
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,799
And start commenting on that what you think should be done

170
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:54,943
And if you don't find any then please open an issue and let us let us fix this issue

171
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,063
I think this will be a tremendous improvement to JCB

172
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,343
Making it

173
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,159
Again with the one of the best

174
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Joomla component

175
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Developing tools

176
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,255
Out there today

177
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:12,351
Where it is even writing your update sequel for you

178
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:17,471
Just by you being busy working and improving your component

179
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
Without being concerned about that

180
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
Thank you for watching
