1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:06,656
I would like to give you a tutorial on the new snippet manager and how it works

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:09,984
We are very excited to announce that

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,544
We have added a community concept

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,312
To the Snippets

5
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,336
In JCB

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,896
Previously

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
You could create your own Snippets

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,456
And then

9
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
If you would to create a custom admin View

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
A site view a template

11
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,832
Or a layout

12
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,648
You could access the snippets

13
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
Through a drop down

14
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
Let me demonstrate that quickly

15
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
So now in a site view

16
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,840
If I were to click on one of these Snippets

17
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:37,376
You see it loads

18
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,656
The snippet here

19
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
You can copy it from here

20
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
And

21
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,264
You can then place it in your code

22
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
And so

23
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,408
It is possible to actually load many Snippets

24
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
Now currently

25
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,784
We already looking here at the new Snippets

26
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Area

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,600
You see that now

28
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:00,160
We have the type of the snippet

29
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:00,928
First

30
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,464
Then the name of the snippet

31
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:04,256
And then the library

32
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:05,536
The snippet belongs to

33
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,888
Once you've selected the snippet again and updates here

34
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
The name of the snippet

35
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
The type of snippet

36
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
And the library it belongs to

37
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,312
And usually this library is a link

38
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,200
It'll open you to the actual documentation on that library's website of the specific snippet

39
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,088
So that's all as it used to be nothing fancy nothing much different

40
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Yet

41
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
There is a major change

42
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,440
Taken place

43
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:34,720
Because now

44
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,536
We have what is known as local Snippets

45
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,584
And then community snippets

46
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
We have

47
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
Actually enlarge the Snippets area

48
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:48,032
So that you can contribute to the community Snippets

49
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,848
And also import

50
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,432
From those Snippets that is been added to the community

51
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
By others

52
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Now how does that exactly work

53
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,552
Well

54
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
Snippets that already exist

55
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,464
Are usually Snippets that either I made or

56
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,000
Someone else and

57
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
They already have

58
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
What is known as a contributor

59
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,424
The name of the contributor it's email address

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
web adress and so forth

61
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
So when you create a snippet

62
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,568
We will use your details

63
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,640
To actually create this contribution

64
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,200
So if we open an existing snippet

65
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,832
And you go to the contribution area you'd see that there is names in these

66
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,600
Fields

67
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
If there aren't any names

68
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,928
Then

69
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,536
Well that means the update didn't do exactly what it should have done

70
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
And when you

71
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
Go to the Snippets area

72
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:49,216
Where you get Snippets I'll show you that in a moment

73
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:53,824
There is a place for you to actually update all the contributor names

74
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,408
And so be sure to have their names actually in the database

75
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,040
The reality is these details should actually be in there already

76
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,576
If they are not

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,672
Well it's not a snippet you made so you don't need to really worry about it

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:12,768
These details only really apply when you wanna share a snippet

79
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,400
And all when you wanna improve a snippet and then we will add the correct details in any way

80
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,960
So really it's not to be worried about

81
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:25,568
But here you'll see how the contributed details

82
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,848
Are

83
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Dealt with

84
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,016
We are using your company details that is set in the global options you could click this button to get there

85
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,368
Under the company tab of the JCB for the new Snippets you create

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
You cannot change the contributed details after snippet

87
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
That already exist

88
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,536
At this time via this area

89
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,328
So that is a simple heads Up

90
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,888
This area is really only for

91
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,192
The management of the community Snippets

92
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:57,312
If you're not gonna be contributing then this doesn't even matter at all

93
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
What is important though

94
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Is that your snippet

95
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
be

96
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Mapped the same way

97
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
As the Snippets in the community

98
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,064
For example if the grid

99
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,648
UI kit version 2 is called layout

100
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
Then don't change it

101
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,280
Because it will then behave like a new snippet and not like an existing one

102
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
You see because the community

103
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:20,607
Uses the name

104
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,167
The library and the type

105
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,191
To build

106
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,727
The filename

107
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,263
The file names

108
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,591
Well we'll look at that also as we go along

109
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
What I mean by file name

110
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,943
For now all you really need to know

111
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,271
Is it there are a bunch of Snippets already in your component

112
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,575
These snippets were shipped with Joomla

113
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Component Builder

114
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
You know

115
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,159
So it

116
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,183
It means that

117
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Really this is how it was

118
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:47,743
By Default

119
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,583
But we now have an area called Get Snippets

120
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
Now

121
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:57,983
If you are one of those who like to get your name out there and want to

122
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:02,591
Become you know involved in the JCB community and have others

123
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
know about you and so forth

124
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,455
Well this is the ideal time to do that

125
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
If you share a snippet

126
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,831
So let say you created this snippet for example

127
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:19,231
Then you would click on Share Snippets or you could take more than one doesn't need to be only one

128
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
You take and you Clicks share Snippets

129
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
This will then create a package let me show you

130
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,727
So we see that it's created a package it's placed it

131
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
In this folder

132
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,407
And you got a few helper tutorials here to actually get you going

133
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,759
So if you wanna learn well this tutorial I'm making now will be

134
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,783
This link here

135
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
And if you wanna learn

136
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,599
More about Git

137
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:46,623
It's this one here

138
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,415
And if you

139
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
Want to know how the forking is gonna work then it's this

140
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,303
And if you wanna know how to do pull request it

141
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,327
It will be this one

142
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,911
And if there's any issues you can open an issue on GitHub

143
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
So this really gives you a sort of a few links and shortcuts

144
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,287
To actually get

145
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Involved in sharing

146
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,359
Snippets

147
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:10,431
What happens when you've share the snippet

148
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,247
If someone Clicks on Get Snippets

149
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
Then they will see your name

150
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
If that

151
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
That specific snippet

152
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
Comes up

153
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,415
So let me illustrate that

154
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
If we click on Get

155
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Snippets

156
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,303
It might take a moment

157
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,631
Depending on how many Snippets are in the repository at this stage

158
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
Because it buy Ajax it's getting all the Snippets

159
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,751
From GitHub

160
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
And it's building a little page for you

161
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
There we go

162
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,383
It's just loaded the whole bunch of Snippets

163
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,455
The first view shows you all the current Snippets

164
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,783
In the JCB community Snippets

165
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
Repository

166
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,927
You can go to this repository by Simply clicking on this GitHub link here

167
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
It will take you there

168
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:58,815
You can see which of these Snippets are ready in sync

169
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
It's called EQUAL

170
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,631
You click on this here

171
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
It show you what EQUAL means

172
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:10,591
In sync with your local Snippets so it has little Mark here saying it's a local snippet

173
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,383
And it is in sync

174
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:15,455
If you don't want to know more about when is a snippet

175
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
Considered equal

176
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,807
Then click on this little button here

177
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
And also you that like I've said

178
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:25,439
Then if there is a snippet out of date let's say someone

179
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:30,559
Contributed to the community on a specific snippet let's say it this snippet here

180
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,655
Someone saw ok if we If we open the snippet

181
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,519
They they saw this little snippet and they thought you know we could do better and they improved on it

182
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,103
And then shared it with the community

183
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,687
Then that snippet will end up in the out-of-date tab

184
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:50,271
If there is no out of date Snippets then all be blank like now

185
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
But if there is

186
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,599
Snippets that are out of date

187
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
They all show up here

188
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
Then there is the new tab

189
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
Now the new tab

190
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Well that could be

191
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
a little bit misleading

192
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,679
Because in this example that I'm giving you I went and I deleted a snippet from my Database

193
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,775
And since that snippet already exists in the community

194
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
It realize the system

195
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:17,663
Then detects ok well that snippet isn't here so it must be new

196
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,223
That's how it basically worked out that little

197
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,503
Some

198
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:22,783
Now you could click on this

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,063
Get snippet

200
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,623
And it will automatically

201
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,671
It says here

202
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:34,047
Are you sure would like to add this new JCB community snippet to your local Snippets you says yeah ok

203
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:36,351
And then it goes to GitHub

204
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:39,167
Gets the snippet and moves it to your Database

205
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
And Boom

206
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
You done

207
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:46,591
So now this snippet is no longer new if you click here you'll see its oh no new snippets

208
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,151
It is now also been added locally

209
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
Then diverged Snippets is where

210
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:57,343
There is a discrepancy in both the creation date as well as the

211
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,367
Modified date

212
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,975
And then those snippets will show up here and they can be updated in the same way

213
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:07,583
If you have made a change to a snippet in your local environment

214
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,863
And then

215
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,959
You've realized oh that changes hasn't been good there's been a better

216
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
You know

217
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
Just to return back to the old

218
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,335
Community version

219
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
Then you would come here to the head

220
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
I made a little change to this

221
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,199
Pacific snippet

222
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,783
And they'll tell you that the snippet is ahead and if you click on it

223
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,807
They'll show you

224
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,087
What that would mean

225
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,415
You can then click on get snippet

226
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
To really revert

227
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,535
Back to the old one and that's what it will tell you

228
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,887
Oh sure you would like to update your local snippet with the older

229
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
JCB community snippet

230
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,287
So you can say no I like my new snippet I don't want to update in just ignore it

231
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,615
But if you wanna go back then that there is this option

232
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
To do so

233
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
If this is a good snippet

234
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,991
You might wanna consider sharing it with the rest of us

235
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,551
An and that would be to actually

236
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,599
Be to actually do the sharing snippet

237
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:04,927
And go through those tutorials in knowing how that works

238
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:08,767
There is sometimes a situation where a specific

239
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,303
one of

240
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
The community

241
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Might be very enthusiastic

242
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:17,471
And he contributes let's say 300 new Snippets to the community Snippets

243
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,751
Repository

244
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:25,663
Now that would mean that you know you wanna click on every one of those snippets get snippet get snippet that might be very

245
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Tedious

246
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,991
So we added this little bulk tool

247
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
Now the bulk tool is able to

248
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
Detect whether there are new Snippets

249
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
And whether they are ahead Snippets

250
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,463
Or whether you just wanted

251
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:42,047
Just update all of them with this this just get all Snippets

252
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
And so

253
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,215
If there isn't any diverged or any outdated Snippets it will also not be able to do that

254
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:55,103
So here instead of clicking it one at a time you could just click on this and I'll just update all of them for you

255
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
And you're done

256
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:00,479
But if you like me and you wanna know exactly what's going on

257
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:04,319
You could go here you could read the description Ok there's no 

258
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
description

259
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,367
See the usage

260
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
See how the snippet itself looks like

261
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
And if you really like what you see

262
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
You might even want to look at who contributed the snippet

263
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,399
That brings up an important and yet interesting

264
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:19,423
Concept

265
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,823
We have decided that when you contribute a new snippet your name and details will end up here

266
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,663
Like I explained earlier when we looked at the contributor area

267
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,527
Yet when someone makes minor contributions to the snippet

268
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:39,391
We will not necessarily change or you know place this contribution

269
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Contributor's name

270
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Instead

271
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,047
We will let them show up in the blame view so there is a view

272
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
Which is called the blame View

273
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,423
The blame view shows you who changed what part of the code

274
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,703
And when

275
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,775
So whenever there is an improvement on any of the Snippets

276
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:01,151
The GitHub repository tools will help us sort of show you

277
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
Who made those changes

278
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,039
So that's how they will be recognised for their contributions is via the blame

279
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:11,135
Where is if you contribute new Snippets to the JCB community

280
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:14,207
You will actually end up having your details show up here

281
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
And have people be able to click on this link

282
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,863
And actually go to the website you put up as your website

283
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:25,471
So it's an ideal way of getting yourself out there in the JCB community

284
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,871
And at the same time sharing good snippets with the rest of us and make make our life easier I suppose

285
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
Anyway and so

286
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:37,247
That is the really looking at the Get Snippets

287
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Community area

288
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:44,159
And we're excited about this we hope that this will really faster a lot of

289
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,207
Participation

290
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,511
And that it will

291
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,095
Improve JCB constantly because as you know

292
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,143
Snippets are used in these

293
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,703
Four key areas custom admin views

294
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
Site view templates layouts

295
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
And

296
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:01,055
These areas

297
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,663
Are what really the customer sees right the one that uses the component

298
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,991
So we wanna always be sure to have the latest and

299
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
Most

300
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,831
Stable Snippets ready in available

301
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,879
For everyone using JCB

302
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,463
So once you have actually

303
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,767
Imported

304
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,607
The new snippet you were able to see it at the end of your Snippets

305
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,423
So this one is now the latest one we've actually

306
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Imported

307
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
If you open the snippet

308
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,311
You see that contributed details are already in place

309
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,175
And so these contributed details will be updated as you add new Snippets

310
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
If for some reason these

311
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,503
Details are not

312
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,087
In place it will say Dynamic value let me show you there

313
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,623
Please create a new one

314
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,415
Like this

315
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
So

316
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
It says Dynamic field

317
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
When you have created your snippet I'm just gonna do a

318
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:56,351
Simple

319
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
Test here

320
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,167
to illustrate this

321
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Ok so it's obviously

322
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
A test

323
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
And you click save

324
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
oh missed a value

325
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
And you click save

326
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:14,271
It will first

327
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,063
Search the

328
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,231
JCB snippet repository to see if there really is a snippet with this kind of a relationship

329
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
Between the name the type and the library

330
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
If it doesn't exist

331
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
It will go to your Global area like explained

332
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,959
And they will get your details

333
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,519
And dynamically added in

334
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,287
to

335
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
The the snippet

336
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
So there we go

337
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:42,687
Its obviously found my details

338
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
and put it in there

339
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,783
So that is how this details get set

340
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
When you create a snippet a new one

341
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,391
It will fall back to your details

342
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,183
If that snippets name

343
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:58,303
Type and library relationship doesn't already exist in the JCB

344
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
Community

345
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,631
Now if for some reason

346
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
It does exist

347
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,447
It will actually

348
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,543
Take the initial contributors details and add that in there

349
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,639
That's how it works at this stage maybe there is better ways but

350
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,455
For now this is how we will start at least

351
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:21,855
And I'm sure it will evolve and change as we go along until we are able to actually

352
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,903
satisfy all and everyone's needs

353
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
I think that's enough of an overview

354
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Of how everything works

355
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
So you've

356
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,887
Seen how to use the Snippets in your components

357
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
You've seen how to

358
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,751
Start initial steps of sharing a snippet

359
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
You simply select them like I showed you

360
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
Obviously

361
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:47,711
Only when you have improved on it or whether you've created new ones will you ever wanna do that

362
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,295
And then you click on Share snippet and gives you a package

363
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
And

364
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Then on that it

365
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Let me just show you again

366
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:00,767
On that it has a

367
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Few tutorials like

368
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,119
Tutorials I'm forking the JCB Snippets

369
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,399
And

370
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,959
