1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,584
I would like to explain it all more to you

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,888
About all the changes we've made

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,424
To the field area

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,032
The field area is really the foundation of most

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,312
Of your component

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,944
As it is what actually causes many of the behaviour and

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,480
Concepts

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,808
Which you might have in your views

9
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
Are all based on the field

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,696
So the field area was a difficult place to change

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,024
And it is still in progress

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,816
So of this video

13
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
The interface most probably won't change much

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,936
Just little tweaks here and there

15
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,032
But the backend of how we deal with the data we're certainly going to

16
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,568
Continue improving that

17
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,920
Just give you a quick recap of how it used to look

18
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,712
If we go to an older

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,736
Install

20
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,784
Of JCB in

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,832
So that's open a field here

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,184
if we open the Elias here

23
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:06,304
We would see that it has this XML field definition area

24
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:09,376
As in the past it was very easy to leave out

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
Maybe leave out

26
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,008
Anything by accident change

27
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,800
Something and then it breaks

28
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
So

29
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,616
That was a little bit

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:25,760
Yeah we had lot of Freedom and as developers I'm sure there's didn't feel

31
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,552
Anyway to be a problem

32
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:28,320
I mean

33
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:32,928
Whatever you selected we build the XML for you and you could just adapt

34
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,976
 it as you please

35
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,280
Yet

36
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:43,424
Since we are trying to make JCB more stable and obviously eventually

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,216
Much more user friendly

38
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,056
This new feature was suggested

39
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:50,848
From

40
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
Inside of the team

41
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
And we decided to add it

42
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,968
So what

43
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
What did we do we basically removed

44
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,064
This XML definition

45
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
And we have replaced it

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:08,768
With a subform we've moved the database values to its own tabs

47
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,352
We also moved the field information to its own tab

48
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,632
And so

49
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
We add a lot of more

50
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
Structure and tools to the page

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,800
And I'm very sure you gonna be very

52
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:24,384
Happy to see the things we've done so let's show you that

53
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,968
So as of version 2.7.5

54
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,784
Which is the stable release of the Strange

55
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:38,464
You'll see that if we open that same Elias which we did just now

56
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
You see it looks like this now

57
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
So you have a subform here

58
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,864
Basically having those values

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
in a subform layout

60
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
And you have now

61
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:51,008
a lot of new information here

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,824
It also got the database in its own tab

63
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,432
And then the type info is still available and you can still come and

64
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
You know review

65
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,552
The reality is the new option

66
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,088
Still gives you the

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
The ability to select

68
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,488
other on add of those fields which

69
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
Are not already on the page so you could still say ok I want to add size here and we still load the description of

70
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,496
The field on the page and the default value

71
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Which you can then change

72
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,128
Except like here when it tells you that it must be text

73
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
We have not yet

74
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:34,016
Blocked this field from being changed

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:38,880
Or being removed though it's mandatory so there's still a level of

76
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,464
Caution required , you could still break it

77
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,304
Although no you can't really break it whatever is mandatory

78
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,352
If you actually do leave it out

79
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,656
on compiling

80
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
The component

81
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:54,240
We will detect that it's mandatory

82
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:57,056
And if you obviously didn't add a value

83
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
It will fall back to its default value

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
So that's how it currently behaves

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
But I wouldn't

86
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
Rather I wouldn't develop

87
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
That way best practice is to put in the value

88
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
And make sure that is correct

89
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
So that's the new

90
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,464
Field area

91
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
We've put a lot of work into this

92
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
And there has been some

93
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:22,911
Hiccups and

94
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Bugs which we have ironed out

95
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,799
The predominantly all those we know about

96
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:33,407
The new we also added this new option it's not yet

97
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
Yeah we haven't fully

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:40,319
Release some of the features but there is this option who's gonna sort of

99
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Separate

100
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
If use the custom

101
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Field currently

102
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
It adds the PHP here

103
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:50,303
In the rows which

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
Is a little tedious if you wanna change this

105
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,911
To keep track of the open braces

106
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,007
And all that in this way is little challenging

107
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
So what we did

108
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
And I can show you a little

109
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,615
Peek of that it will be in

110
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
In version

111
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,943
2.7.6

112
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:11,039
So you watching this video after those releases you possibly

113
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,063
already have it

114
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:18,463
So the new let me show you click on new this is now the new implementation for the custom

115
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,487
Fields

116
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
And also for custom user

117
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
So you click on it

118
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:26,655
It actually takes the PHP

119
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
And adds it to it's own little text area

120
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:33,823
to now here you can easily follow and adapt

121
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
The get options methods

122
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,919
PHP values

123
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
And that's

124
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,503
Quite

125
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
More convenient I suppose

126
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,367
Then using one line at a time

127
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
So we look at the user

128
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
You got two fields then one folder

129
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
Get exclude method and one for the Get group method

130
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
And so they also

131
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Immediately available to you

132
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:03,263
The other advantage with this implementation

133
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,287
Is

134
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
We have this new

135
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,127
Extra properties

136
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,663
Option which

137
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,991
Has been available in JCB  for some time now

138
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
But many of you may not know that it exists

139
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,367
So there is this what we call list class

140
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:22,719
If you wanna add a class like a CSS class

141
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
Value

142
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,351
To this field when it appears in the list area

143
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
That is the

144
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,911
Let me show you

145
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:34,751
This area this is the list area while any of the

146
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:38,591
Views we see a list of items and you want this value

147
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
Specific value

148
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,663
To have a

149
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:45,503
Specific CSS class value because maybe you wanna

150
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
Style it

151
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,807
Somewhat different

152
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,623
Then you have this option

153
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,183
To a use basically all you do

154
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,719
As you just say

155
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
List class

156
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,559
And you add there

157
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,327
My

158
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:01,887
Class

159
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,799
But whatever you wanna call it

160
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:10,847
And

161
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
Then

162
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,919
It will add that the class

163
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
To the

164
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223
To the field

165
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
In the list area which is

166
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Quite stunning

167
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
There is also the escape

168
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
Option which

169
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,695
If you escape

170
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:26,719
A value

171
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:30,047
All the values are escaped by Default

172
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:33,887
So if you want a value not to be escaped

173
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
Because you gonna maybe 

174
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,591
 have values in it which if it's escaped gets stripped

175
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Like a span tag and stuff like that

176
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
You could say files here

177
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
And then the specific fields

178
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
That what I say escaped I mean in the list area again

179
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
This area

180
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,159
When there is a list value

181
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,487
Then this is a being escaped at the moment

182
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
And if you don't want that done

183
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,863
Then you add this false escaped

184
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,495
The other option which is also available here is the display option

185
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,335
We'll still add some more documentation to this

186
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:19,455
But basically it's about when the field gets displayed

187
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
In a config

188
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,039
You know your it's component

189
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,575
Has a

190
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,855
let me see here

191
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:33,279
Got this options area right and you can actually add Fields to that option area

192
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,607
And when a field is added to the option area

193
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:43,263
It it has implementation structures you could have it show in the menu you could have it show in various

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
Places. I'll make a

195
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,567
Tutorial

196
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
About this specifically

197
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:52,479
But just to show you quickly that that is also actually available here

198
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
And then

199
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,855
 last but not least validate

200
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Not all Fields have the property

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
To validate the value

202
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,255
But here is the validation rules

203
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,791
And you can

204
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,071
Basically

205
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,887
Add a validation to this field

206
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,263
If that property is not available in the field type which you have selected

207
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,543
now

208
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,359
If it is we would suggest you add it

209
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:22,431
the properties here at the top

210
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,223
And it actually says that

211
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:27,807
 if you have a validation set

212
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:30,879
as a field property this extra property will not be needed

213
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,927
Because you can just use that one

214
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:37,535
Ok so that's just a quick demonstration really

215
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,607
Of the new field area and

216
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
We trust that it will

217
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,727
Be as easy and as comfortable as we hoped

218
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
It would be

219
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,055
that the Strange would

220
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,871
Will not frustrate you but actually be great

221
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
Because of the reason that for example

222
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,015
One of the

223
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
Sort of unforeseen

224
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:01,855
Outcomes

225
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:05,439
Is if you have a field like this which already has all it's values

226
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
And you thinking on changing it

227
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,559
And you say, let me just check 

228
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,607
How will text look

229
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:18,239
You can change it and it really adds all your text value here with its defaults

230
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
And if you say no I wanna go back

231
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
You can actually just click back

232
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
And

233
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:25,663
  lo and behold your old values

234
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,223
Are again added to the page

235
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:31,039
The values that were there originally

236
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,671
And that is even true if you were to remove a specific

237
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,695
Property

238
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
Then wanna add it back

239
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
It actually adds the

240
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,351
Original value back

241
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:45,375
Which was

242
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,167
What we intended because

243
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
By accident

244
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,799
You might remove it and wanna just put it back and it should be as easy as that

245
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,103
You could obviously still go to

246
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,895
Type info to see

247
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
What what could be the

248
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
The actual values

249
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
Default values

250
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,087
And adapt them

251
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:08,415
So it's not like you don't have access to the default values

252
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,695
it's just that we

253
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
want to

254
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,743
Recover your

255
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,791
Current saved value for you

256
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:19,679
And then whenever you add another field which isn't already here

257
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
This drop down list only shows the fields

258
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,543
That are not already on the page

259
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,359
So you won't end up adding fields

260
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
 properties the second time

261
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,807
And yes so now it's become much more easier I suppose

262
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
To build fields

263
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:39,391
Based on it's Properties

264
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
As before

265
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
You really had to

266
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Navigate

267
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Through

268
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
Some of the complexities

269
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,351
Of dealing with an XML

270
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Set of values

271
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:53,215
Which maybe some of you don't even know exactly what's going on here

272
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,543
And those of you that do I mean

273
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:02,175
It's it's not like you're losing any advantage with the new implementation

274
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:06,015
You still targeting that value with any value want

275
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:11,647
And it's still as easy as clicking a plus and selecting a value and adding it

276
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
And so I

277
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,535
I do hope that all of you will be as excited about this change

278
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
As we are

279
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
.

280
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,655
We are now at the point where

281
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,775
Making JCB easy-to-use is also a priority

282
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
K well thanks for watching
