1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
So we have added another nice sort of improvement I would say by request

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,448
of one of our

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,520
fellow

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,056
developers.

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,128
Whenever you create a field

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,248
You always have to once you have selected the field type,

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
say for instance a 'List'

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
or

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
, let's make it 'Text' for now.

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,440
There is the Text field(See video).

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,536
You can set up the properties

12
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
as usual and

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,400
remove whatever values you do not want and then

14
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,216
you need to set the database values

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,240
every time.

16
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,872
Although you might be using the same database set of values for specific type of

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
 field types you need to set an every time which

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
is cumbersome.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,208
So we have added a new feature which is not active by default.

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,024
It because we want

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
you

22
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
to know that it

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
does that.  We want  you to set it.

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,544
In doing so you can set it the way it works for you

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,128
which means you still need to know a little bit of

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
 how the database values should be stored.

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,272
For example 'Number'

28
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
that could be

29
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
most unlikely that it is not an integer. 

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
So we can

31
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
can say integer

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
11

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
and leave the rest like that and, Save.

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:48,032
So now we have the default database value for 'Number' set.

35
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
If we

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
next time open a New field

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
and select 'Number'

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
it will

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
automatically add that database values. You can of course still change

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
them

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
to maybe a larger integer or whatever  is appropriate for your purpose at this stage

42
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,216
but it sort of gives you that little bit of,

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
yes

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,408
continual use of already

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
decided values

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
regarding a database

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
for this specific field type.

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
That is just a quick demonstration.

49
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
I am sure that there is not really much to it.

50
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
You can now go through your field types

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
and

52
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,168
choose for example, ' Telephone'.

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
You are always going to

54
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
use' Varchar', maybe 64

55
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568


56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
and

57
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896


58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
set that up

59
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
and

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
so you could go on.

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
We can say 'Text'

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
also to

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
to varchar

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464


65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
255

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
and

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,608


68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,680
 so you could set a lot of default

69
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,288
database values for your fields. 

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
