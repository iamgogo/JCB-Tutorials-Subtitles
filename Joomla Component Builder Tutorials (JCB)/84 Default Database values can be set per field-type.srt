1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
So we've added another nice sort of improvement I would say by request

2
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,448
Of one of our

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:11,520
Shallow

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,056
Developers

5
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,128
Whenever you create a field

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:21,248
You always have to answer select the field type

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
That's a list

8
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Or

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
It's like it takes 1 hour

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,440
Text field

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,536
You can set up the properties

12
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Usual

13
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:38,400
Remove whatever values you don't want and then

14
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:41,216
You need to save the database values

15
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,240
Every time

16
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,872
Although you might be using the same database set of values for specific type of

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
Fields field types you need to set an every time he wishes

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Is the word cumbersome

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,208
So we added a new feature it's not active by default

20
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:05,024
So that's because we want

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
You

22
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
To know that it's

23
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
Does that so it's like they want you to set it

24
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,544
In doing so you will sell it the way it works for you

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,128
Which means you still need to know a little bit of

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
You know how the database values to be stored

27
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,272
Bathroom sample number

28
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,576
It could be

29
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,696
Most unlikely that it's not an integer so

30
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
So we could

31
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
We could take integer

32
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
11

33
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,144
And leave the rest like that safe

34
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:48,032
So now we basically have the default database value phone number

35
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,312
If we

36
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,640
Next time open a field in Newfield

37
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
And select number

38
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:57,760
It will

39
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
Automatically add that has the database values you can of course still changed

40
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
2

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:12,352
To maybe a larger integer or whatever is is appropriate for your purpose that this state

42
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,216
But it helps you sort of gives you that little bit of

43
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Yes

44
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,408
Can you use of already

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
Decided values

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
Regarding a database

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
For the specific field type

48
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,136
Ok so that's just a quick demonstration

49
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
I'm sure that there's not really much to it

50
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:40,768
You can now go through your field types

51
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Hand

52
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:47,168
Choose for example ok telephone

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
Always Gonna

54
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,776
Use voucher you know

55
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Ab64

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,128
And

57
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Yeah

58
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Set that up

59
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,456
And

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,504
So you could go on

61
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
I get said text

62
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
Also to

63
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,672
To varchar

64
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,464
2

65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,512
255

66
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:13,792
And

67
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,608
Yeah the girls just be like that

68
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,680
And so you could set a lot of default

69
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,288
Database values for your Fields well enjoy

70
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Thanks for watching
