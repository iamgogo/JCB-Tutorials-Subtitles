1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,048
I want to

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:03,584
Demonstrate

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,424
The way to add JCB packages to the community

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
Directory

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,592
The moment if you go to import JCB packages this now in new tab called community 

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
Packages

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,968
Where we would like to encourage all of you to start sharing packages

8
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,064
Main focus or purpose for it would become

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,856
To be quick start

10
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,136
For developing

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,160
Components

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
it could serve

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
As a back up for yourself too easily

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,560
Pull on old

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,888
Packages that you've developed

16
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,472
To maybe have a specific feature for example

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,032
Linking your Joomla users

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,824
 into your component

19
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,896
I know apps or componants that does that

20
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,456
And I often want to reuse that

21
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,224
So

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,016
You can now with this new

23
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,040
Idea

24
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:58,624
Be able to import that component over and over

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,184
I without merging it with

26
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,464
The old version

27
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,256
But actually creating a new

28
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,328
Component including Fields and everything else

29
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
And so that way

30
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
You are able to quickly start a new project

31
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,544
And you don't need to really do all that over again and again

32
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
It's sort of similar as the Clone feature that now has become available so they JCB components now

33
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:24,992
Clone feature

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
You could select a component

35
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
And you can clone it

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,880
And in cloning it

37
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:32,928
It basically creates

38
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,488
A Exact Copy of the component

39
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,024
But not linked

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
To the components so even did admin views

41
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
You see it actually create a new admin View

42
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
And the same goes for the fields

43
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,288
You actually created

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
a whole new

45
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,616
set of fields

46
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Specifically

47
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
For this component you see it's got the same

48
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
Suffix

49
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,272
(EO)

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,808
Ok so

51
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,672
That is the Clone feature and now the import feature has the same functionality

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,000
So if I was to go and say let's import

53
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
The demo component

54
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,584
Then

55
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,632
Once it has

56
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,960
gotten the component from GitHub

57
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
We will see

58
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
That it has this merge option or no don't merge now

59
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,176
Remember we

60
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:30,528
Already have the demo component here and it is exactly the same component

61
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,600
But I don't want it to update this one

62
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
I want it to really

63
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,952
Bring it in as a new component and then I will

64
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:44,608
detect this to No and it does give you a little explanation here and also tells you that the paradation rules

65
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,424
Field types snippet languages and language strings

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
These things will still be merged

67
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
And that simply is unavoidable

68
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
Ok and then if you wanna see

69
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,152
You know what happens on the hood

70
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
And then you click on continue

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,784
And what it will do now

72
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,624
Obviously give you a whole lot of information of the import

73
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
And also whatever files it moved

74
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,512
But it actually created a new component

75
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,072
It didn't update the old one

76
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,912
And that is a very nice option because now

77
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:22,752
You can quickly start with this component without affecting this one

78
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
Now you'll see that

79
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
Even the admin view is

80
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,688
Dislocated it's not the same admin View

81
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,320
The same again with the fields so if we look at the fields you'll see it also has the (Ra)

82
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
Suffix

83
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,648
to it (Ra)  (Ra)

84
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:43,232
This name doesn't anywhere appear

85
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:46,816
In the compiled version of the components it's all system names

86
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,400
So this (Ra) will just be for your own

87
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,680
to know that this

88
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,984
Field belongs to this component and so on

89
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
So that's sort of what the new JCB package import option is sort of been improved to to manage

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,224
Now with the community option

91
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
You can actually do what we wanna call

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
What is a share

93
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,112
Like I've been doing

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:10,880
Sharing

95
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,952
So many in a lot of information with all of you

96
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,000
Components tools

97
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,839
And so the idea that all of you would have this attitude of

98
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,887
Giving back to the community

99
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:26,495
And the other option is that if you want to distribute a package

100
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,823
And at the same time maybe get some marketing

101
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,871
This is also gonna be doing that

102
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,039
Ok, so let me illustrate to you the process of getting a package into the community

103
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Packages

104
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
We are going to use

105
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:42,623
GitHub

106
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:47,231
Basically this repository JCB community packages

107
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:48,767
This is the URL

108
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,559
VDM -

109
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
IO

110
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
/

111
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,935
JCB - community - packages

112
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
You will need to fork this package

113
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,615
I'm not gonna teach you how to use GitHub

114
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,919
 neither how to use Git

115
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,479
I'm gonna illustrate it just by doing it

116
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,575
Doing what you need to do

117
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,111
Demonstrating it to you

118
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
But I'm not gonna teach you how to do this in a

119
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
More thorough away

120
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,999
So you need to

121
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,791
Go and study up GitHub

122
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:22,559
And Git

123
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,375
Specifically to be able to manage this

124
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:31,007
And what will happen is anyone who wants to add a package must start by forking

125
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
The repository

126
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,871
And then once it's been forced

127
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
They need to clone it down to their the developing environment

128
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,527
Where they have JCB

129
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:45,599
Or to where they can move a JCB package

130
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:50,463
Because at the end of the day they need to add their package which they want to contribute

131
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,511
To their forked version

132
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,535
Of

133
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
This

134
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,095
JCB community packages

135
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,215
And then once they done all that and pushed up the changes to their repository

136
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Then they'll make a pull request

137
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,567
To add the change

138
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Into the community

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,919
Version of this repository now

140
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,967
Hope that all makes sense to you

141
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
You'll get the URL here

142
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,063
On your own repository

143
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
Copy that

144
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,391
And then you'll go to your

145
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,695
Developing environment

146
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,719
Hopefully

147
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,767
It will be Linux

148
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,815
Because you need to

149
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
Run a bash script, so

150
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
Needs to be a bash environment

151
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
And

152
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,775
Yeah so you could run it in a VM where ever you want

153
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,359
Just get it going so I'm gonna open a terminal now

154
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,711
And then the terminal I'm simply gonna clone

155
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,503
 this repository

156
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:56,767
And then once it's finished cloning it we gonna change to that directory

157
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,191
Now if we list out

158
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,215
The items

159
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
You will see that it is exactly the same as what we have here on GitHub

160
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
It is in literally the same

161
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
Information

162
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,759
So it is actually a folder a folder on your computer

163
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,111
And we will then now need to go to JCB

164
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,671
Extract the package you want to share

165
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,975
And simply place it into this folder

166
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
And then Run

167
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,815
This hash.sh script

168
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
Ok

169
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
So let me do that

170
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
So here we are in our

171
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:39,007
JCB program

172
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:42,591
And I want to share this question and answers

173
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,991
 component and I would ask that you won't share things that do not work

174
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:53,855
If you still busy developing the thing then it is not time to share it yet

175
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
But when it's ready

176
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:00,511
And you know that it works that means you've compiled it and tested it and you know it stable

177
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
Then anyone share it

178
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,143
Does need to be a big component it could have just one View

179
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,679
Doesn't matter

180
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:11,007
But it needs to be something other than already what exist

181
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,079
So no more new demo components

182
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,639
it need to be something else

183
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
So

184
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,735
Always please check that if you wanna contribute something

185
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,783
Be something that's already there

186
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
If there is already one

187
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,927
And you want to improve it sure then you can do that you can

188
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:32,767
pull it in make it better and make it pull request to improve it

189
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,607
But just know that we will have to be able to test it

190
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,399
So if you're using a key

191
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:41,983
Then the person that you get it from

192
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
You can't

193
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,799
Contributed without a key

194
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,335
Back in fact

195
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,639
If someone places

196
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
A package in the

197
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:50,943
Community

198
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
And has a key

199
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Then

200
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,551
it sort of lockout everybody else

201
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
Because then only they can improve it

202
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:01,439
But as soon as I take the key away

203
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,023
Then everybody else can improve it because there is no key

204
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:07,583
And doesn't matter we all can check it out

205
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Ok

206
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:09,375
So

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,191
I'm not exactly sure how all this is gonna workout

208
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:17,311
I am very open to all of you to just give me feedback input how you think this should be done

209
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
The idea is not to

210
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Infringe on each other's projects

211
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,527
But to help each other get projects going quite quickly

212
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,319
That's really the agenda

213
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:34,719
The idea is if you wanna build a project let's get something that can sort of serve as a base

214
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,279
From which to start so this question and answers

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:41,119
Program is there is a very nice base it's got just

216
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
Few views a few fields

217
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
It's got a very simple straight forward implementation of 

218
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
Q&A for your front in of your website

219
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,383
And so I thought well this is a nice thing to

220
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,663
to sort of use

221
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,711
As a demonstration

222
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
So I'm gonna export this

223
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:02,623
Wait a minute let me just show you something else before we do that

224
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
Is going to the component

225
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:06,207
And

226
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,047
those of you who want to maybe give away the component

227
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
But you want to sort of

228
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,911
have people first visit

229
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:16,703
Maybe a video that you've made

230
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
The way you could do this

231
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:23,103
Is by this Buy Link here you'll basically make that link

232
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Direct to your video

233
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,223
So that when they click on the Buy Link they go to the video

234
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
Were you gonna give them the key for free

235
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,807
And they can

236
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,135
Watch the video get the key come back and open the package

237
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
we're not currently

238
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,975
Already implementing package link

239
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:41,279
The package link should be

240
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Where the package is

241
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,375
Which most of the time will be the repository

242
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,519
Which is why we not fully implementing this because it's sort of yeah we don't need it

243
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:54,847
So we left it here maybe for future purposes

244
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:59,711
But at the moment we don't need it the way we've set up things

245
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,551
You can sort of just use the repo URL 

246
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,135
So it is only the Buy link that's really important

247
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:12,511
If it's not a free package or if it's a free package but you're giving the key away

248
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,839
So the other idea is not add a key at all

249
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
So

250
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
If you don't add a key here

251
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,215
Then it will be a free package

252
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,287
This is how you make something a free package it's just

253
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Leaving the key out

254
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:26,847
That's simple as that

255
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
And

256
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Then it will be a free package

257
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Where as if you leave the key in

258
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:34,271
then people will have to get the key from you

259
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,087
And if you've got a contributor to the community

260
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,623
Then

261
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,743
you'll need to share the key with the admin of the repository

262
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,839
So they can validate the component and check that it's safe for distribution

263
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:51,679
We'll stop with some things in place maybe a forum

264
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,983
Procedure on how to do this

265
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
Inside of JCB or maybe just 

266
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,383
In the read more of the repository

267
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:04,479
 We'll give you a heads up when that happens

268
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,599
For now the explanation is simple if you want to have people get the key from you

269
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,415
Where ever they need to get it weather it's free or paid

270
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:14,207
Needs to be this link here

271
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,487
And

272
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,511
The key

273
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:20,351
This here is what we used to build the key it's not the actual key

274
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
It's just used to build a key so you can put in anything here really

275
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:24,703
Ok

276
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,263
Now once you got all that in place

277
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,823
You will compile your component

278
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:33,919
Or export the JCB package really that's the right name

279
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
once you got the component

280
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Exported

281
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,831
Then the package is available

282
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
in a specific

283
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,951
Directory called "temporal directory" in your

284
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
Developing environment

285
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
And this is the package

286
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
That you wanna add to the repository

287
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,167
This is the key that you now need to give to everybody

288
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
That wants to use the package

289
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:59,007
So this key

290
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
can nowhere to be found

291
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
unless on this page

292
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:04,639
 where you compiled it

293
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,455
 store this key in a safe place

294
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
Or use it in your video

295
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,807
 and give it to the people in the right playtime

296
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,135
Whatever you like to to do this

297
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,279
The Next Step would be to now move this package into

298
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,047
The

299
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
Repository which we cloned down to your local developing environment

300
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:32,287
Here I got the folder open where the package is so you see there

301
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,103
Is following that path which we found

302
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
When we look at this it's same path

303
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,247
So basically we gonna just drag

304
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:42,527
And drop

305
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:46,111
The file into the other folder which is where that

306
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,415
Clone repository is at the moment

307
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:50,207
In my home folder

308
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
So here we have

309
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,279
The package been added

310
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,303
And

311
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
We basically done

312
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,143
And we can close this one out

313
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,679
And go back to the terminal

314
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,287
Once in a terminal if you say get

315
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
Status

316
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
You see that it tells you that is one file

317
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
That isn't

318
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
 been tracked

319
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,831
Now before you add the file

320
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
You first need to run

321
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
The hash.sha

322
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
...

323
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
 program

324
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:24,511
Which is a bash little script

325
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:29,375
So you need bash to run it and a few other two other programs actually

326
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:32,191
I'm pretty sure you that

327
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
It's this

328
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
JQ and sha1sum

329
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,871
These two programs is also required

330
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,455
And that the script will actually shout at you that

331
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:47,551
 if it doesn't exist will say hey , you need to get these

332
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:48,575
So if you

333
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
You can just 

334
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Google JQ

335
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Bash

336
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,439
Install and it will

337
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,975
Give you information

338
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,535
And adding these two programs to your

339
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:58,815
Developing environment

340
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:00,351
And then run that script

341
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,655
What that script will do

342
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
is very simple

343
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,031
it'll go through the files in the repository that are zip files that's what it does here

344
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:09,311
it will create a sum

345
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,615
And then will place the sum

346
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,431
In a file with the same name except

347
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,735
Added the sha to the file name

348
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
So there it adds it

349
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:21,599
Then it will 

350
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,951
 get a shop file name and then unzip

351
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,511
The file to get the info.

352
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:30,815
VDM file from the zip package

353
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,375
Then change that to the shop filename

354
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
Which should be the same as your package name just with info as the prerogative

355
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,847
Which is what we need to show the people what your package name is and who owns it and these things

356
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
So that's where that info come from

357
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,711
Then it takes that information and

358
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,015
It adds it to an array

359
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
Which

360
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
Then later gets written to the checksum.json

361
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
That's all this does

362
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,415
Nothing

363
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:59,743
Not not no not smart really it's just straight forward

364
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Some Little Bash

365
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,095
Do to get the information from the file

366
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,911
For you without your having any issues

367
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:07,935
And that it

368
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Just follow convention

369
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
So I'm gonna go run the file now and you can see what it does

370
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:20,223
So basically you add the the Dot here make sure in the repository then the Dot

371
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
And then

372
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,295
The hash.sh

373
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,623
And enter and it should just do that simple as that

374
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
Shouldn't take long and if it did

375
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,719
Then something is wrong

376
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,511
This is all it should do

377
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:36,351
Now if you again do the git status

378
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
You'll see that now there are actually 3 files

379
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,519
That of not be tracked and tricks some file

380
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:45,311
Has been modified

381
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:49,407
And why because there is now a new line been added

382
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
To check some so if we do

383
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Git

384
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
diff

385
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:57,599
You'll see that your component the one that you are adding

386
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:02,719
This one

387
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,023
Is being added

388
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,863
And so that line was changed because it got a comma

389
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
But this is the new line that it is added

390
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,239
So basically just added your component

391
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
To the check some

392
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,823
And that is all that should change

393
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:20,639
You shouldn't change any other files

394
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
In the repository

395
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,223
Only the ones that you are contributing

396
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
Are the ones that you must change

397
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,575
Ok so

398
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
There we go

399
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,135
The next thing is to git

400
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
Add

401
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,183
Those files

402
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
So if you do git

403
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
Status

404
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
They are now green

405
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
now the comment

406
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
The comment

407
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
I think

408
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:45,983
We there's like Convention out there

409
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,287
I'm not so keyed up all that

410
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,847
So the moment I think we can do

411
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,127
Git

412
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Then

413
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,199
Add it

414
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,111
Questions and answers package I think that's simple enough

415
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,647
And then

416
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:04,927
Press enter

417
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,023
Oops I left out something and it's to commit word

418
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
So she say git commit

419
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Then a m

420
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,959
The m is for the message in the a is for pushing it all into the branch

421
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,543
So there we go and then you have if you have a pass phrase

422
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
and you

423
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Which I should actually have

424
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,479
Then there you have your commit signed

425
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,879
If you don't know how to sign commits in git then please Google that and get your keys in place

426
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,463
We would expect that all commits to this repo

427
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,487
Be signed

428
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
Specially since we need to be sure

429
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,583
That it is you

430
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
That am you know making the commit

431
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,959
Now when you've done all that you do git

432
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
And your push it up

433
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,823
To your repository on GitHub

434
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:58,431
At this point you are still not affecting the community repository

435
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
It is just affecting

436
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,271
The the repository that you forked

437
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
And

438
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
That is

439
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:08,159
This is a very secure way of dealing with this

440
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
So if we now go back to Git

441
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:10,975
Hub

442
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:14,303
And you know were fetch the page

443
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,911
You see that I'll say this branch is one commit ahead of VDM

444
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,727
And then there is this make a pull request

445
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,799
So you make a pull request there

446
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,127
And it will basically take you

447
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:29,663
To the main repository

448
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,063
And all explain to you which one is being pulled where and it will tell you that it is able to be merged

449
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
And

450
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,391
Did this is the information that's being added

451
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,671
For the info

452
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,695
For the sha

453
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,303
And obviously for the package which it doesn't show because it's too big

454
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:49,119
So you see Binary file not shown

455
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
there it is

456
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:53,983
And so there is also the changes to the checksum

457
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Now at this point

458
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,799
You need to

459
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,127
Create a pull request to click on create pull request

460
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
And

461
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
This

462
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:07,551
Comment that you made in your repository when you you know

463
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:11,391
Contributed the package would usually be added as the title

464
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,535
You wanna give a little explanation of things that we as the admin team need to have dissipate

465
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:20,095
Because we got obviously have to test this now

466
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:25,983
We can't add packages to the community packets branch without being able to test it

467
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
So if you have a key for the package

468
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,847
Then

469
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,127
Yes

470
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
I think we will create a form

471
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Eventually

472
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
Where you will be able to submit that

473
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,415
And we'll put that in the information because at the moment this area doesn't even have a pull request template

474
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,231
So we will add a pull request template

475
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:50,815
So that when you create a pull request that tells you where to send the key

476
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:56,447
Set the moment if there's a pull request maybe just keep the packages coming that are free at the moment

477
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,287
as soon as the templates in place then then you can use it

478
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
And then make a pull request

479
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
And

480
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
Then

481
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,199
I'm at the moment the only one that

482
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,271
Manage this but I hope that others would get involved

483
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
There are some other developers already

484
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:15,647
Quite involved on the JCB

485
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
Repository

486
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,536
But I would like to also encourage them to get involved here

487
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
And be able to sort of help me

488
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,144
Test these packages

489
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,936
Make sure that only valid in

490
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,472
Stable packages gets

491
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,240
Added

492
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
And so

493
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:36,384
That's really it here you now click create pull request now I'm gonna do this

494
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,432
Because it's all premature

495
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,712
I I want to

496
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,832
I don't wanna pull this into this

497
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
The repository at the stage

498
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
I'm gonna do so later

499
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,232
But the point is

500
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:54,816
This is the procedure that you need to follow

501
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:58,144
To actually get a package into the community packages

502
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,472
Because once it's get merged into the master branch

503
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
It will also become available on this page

504
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,312
Automatically

505
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:08,384
So automatically it'll show up in this dropdown

506
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
In fact

507
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:13,248
That is a simple as it is

508
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,648
Well thanks for watching and if you have any questions please open a issue

509
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
At the correct place

510
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:25,280
So if you wanna talk about the packages for the community

511
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
Open issue here

512
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:32,192
Please don't make a open issues at JCBs repository regarding this issue

513
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,496
So that we'll have you know clear

514
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
Separation

515
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
Between these two concepts. Ok thanks for watching.
