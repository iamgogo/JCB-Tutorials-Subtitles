1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,608
I would like to give you a quick tutorial on how to install

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
A JCB package

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,192
Or import

4
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:09,472
Is the right word really

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:10,752
Now

6
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,800
At the end of day

7
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
You already have JCB on your

8
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:16,384
System

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,200
So I'm not gonna explain how we got to this point

10
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
But from here on further

11
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,272
There are two ways to

12
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
To get to the in

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
Installing

14
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,600
View

15
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,672
One is by clicking on this icon

16
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,696
It'll take you there

17
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,512
The other one is going to Joomla components

18
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,560
And there is a button

19
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,120
Up here this is import JCB

20
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:37,888
Packages

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,704
And that will take you to the same place

22
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
You'll see that there is a number of tabs here

23
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,848
And you can actually

24
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:48,640
If you don't If you're not interested in these

25
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Two tabs

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,224
There's action option in the global options

27
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Where at this point we are controlling those tabs

28
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344
Through this

29
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,184
Global switch that says manage JCB package the directories

30
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
You can say show all

31
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:03,744
Show none

32
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:05,536
Or manually select

33
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:09,376
The repositories that you want the show at the moment they are the least two

34
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,168
But they are

35
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,496
Reasons to expect that they might become more

36
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
as

37
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
We see

38
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
You know

39
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,616
This area becoming more active

40
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,664
Ok so

41
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,200
Once you're on this page

42
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:29,344
And you have yourself exported a JCB package then this is where you can select it from your

43
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Computer

44
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:32,160
Or from a directory

45
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,952
Or from a URL

46
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
And with these import methods

47
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,352
There is not a checksum validation feature in place

48
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
So you need to be sure of the Integrity of that package

49
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,752
We cannot validate that package integrity

50
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,056
And since if it's being

51
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:53,920
Selected from your desktop and you are in a your local development environment

52
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
There should be no reasons for concern

53
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,552
If you're pulling it from an external source

54
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,832
Then possibly

55
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,856
You need to be more cautious

56
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,744
Where is it when it comes to the VDM packages and the JCB community packages

57
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,840
These are the areas where we are trying to add some layer of

58
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,608
Security

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,912
To try and protect you

60
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
And to ensure that

61
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:21,312
The package area remains as stable as possible

62
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:25,408
And so there is ways for you to add your own JCB package

63
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
To the community repository

64
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
Here is a tutorial to show you how to do that

65
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,808
And

66
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Also

67
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:33,856
Explaining

68
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:34,624
Why

69
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
We will do things

70
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,184
The way we do them

71
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
Because of

72
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
The fact that everybody will then have access to that package

73
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,072
In this area

74
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
You can then also also

75
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
Now get free keys

76
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,496
For the VDM packages

77
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,800
In the past you have to pay for them

78
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,104
And we have decided in

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
In a initiative to

80
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Sort of

81
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,784
Show all of you exactly how JCB can work and function

82
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
We have decided to give these packages way

83
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
Asking you to follow few steps

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,232
In supporting Us by

85
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,536
Forking starring or

86
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
watching

87
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,168
These packages in their specific repositories on GitHub

88
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:21,984
needing more guidance about this

89
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776
You can just click on that link

90
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,824
And they'll show you exactly what you need to

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Do

92
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,360
and once you've

93
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
Got the key for that

94
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:29,920
specific package

95
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,480
You can come and select that package here

96
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Obviously

97
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,064
It's only related to some of the packages at this point

98
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
Which the first being

99
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
Most prominent

100
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,672
Component builder itself

101
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,208
And so I would 

102
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:42,976
Suspect that would

103
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
Would be your First Choice as

104
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Well

105
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:49,888
and once you've selected the package you simply can click on

106
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,656
Get

107
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,936
to

108
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,216
Have the package be

109
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Taken

110
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,264
From GitHub

111
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,032
And Brought

112
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
To your

113
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,848
Developing environment

114
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
And in doing so

115
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:04,992
It will actually run a validation on the Integrity of the package

116
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,784
Because they are checksums

117
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,552
In place

118
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:08,576
But

119
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
You need to validate the check some

120
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,160
Manually

121
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
And the way you do that

122
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it'll show you the checksum that was used

123
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
to evaluate

124
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,536
The

125
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,071
Package integrity

126
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:21,631
And since it's past the validation

127
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,215
You know this checksum is the one that you need to see

128
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
If you're open

129
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,263
This link

130
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:31,359
So opening this link will also reveal a checksum

131
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:35,455
But at this time you will be seeing a verification

132
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
By

133
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Digi

134
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
Cert

135
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,319
And

136
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
It must be at least

137
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
This part of the URL

138
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
Must be correct

139
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,231
Up There

140
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,767
This will vary from package to package

141
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,095
But it should have the package name here

142
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,911
And this should correspond

143
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
To the value you to

144
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
See here

145
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
And that little bit of manual effort

146
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,287
Is all you need to do

147
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,615
To be sure that the package that you have now got

148
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:04,639
In your position

149
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,711
Is the original authentic package that we have

150
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:08,735
distributed

151
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,319
So at this point you're all good to go all you need now

152
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,367
Is to take the key that we have sent you

153
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
And to add it here

154
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,695
To the key area

155
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,231
like so

156
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
Now you need to make a choice

157
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,679
Whether you want to if the JCB already is installed on your system maybe it's the second time you doing this

158
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:33,055
Then you might not want to merge you might want to have it be like a clone

159
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,151
I like a second instance of JCB it will literally

160
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:39,711
Then create all the fields and all the views

161
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
And all the linked

162
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Concepts

163
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,039
Again

164
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
Where is if you choose merge

165
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,111
And

166
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
There is a change in the package which is newer

167
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,743
Then the version you have it will

168
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Actually update

169
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,047
That version

170
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,839
If you wanna force it

171
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,119
To update it

172
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,423
You will say yes up here

173
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
The force local update really Only Works

174
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,543
If you selected merge

175
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,151
Then there's also show all import information

176
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
Which if it is the first time that you're importing package

177
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,527
It might be ideal to to check this yes

178
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,415
Because it'll show you literally everything that it does every field it adds

179
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,791
But it will not show your names or shows your IDs a lot of it will be like ok that doesn't make sense

180
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,815
To see anyway

181
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,863
But at the very bottom of the list

182
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
It shows you that

183
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:33,471
Files that is moved and this is what you need to see

184
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,031
You need to see the files that is moved 

185
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Into your system

186
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,127
Specially if it's not a package that we are providing

187
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,919
Or someone else that is being

188
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Sort of validated through the community

189
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,015
But it's someone that you've

190
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,807
Imported through a URL

191
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
Or through a package from you

192
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,135
Distributor package you received

193
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,927
Or from a directory

194
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,719
Then you most certainly wanna

195
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,511
see all import info

196
00:06:56,767 --> 00:07:02,911
Because you wanna make sure that what they told you is what you get and that's what that little feature is all there

197
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,679
About

198
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,031
Then there is also the component that is being imported should show

199
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:11,103
Here the same as the one you saw before we got the package

200
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
Now those of you that have used this area multiple times

201
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
You will know

202
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
That you're actually able to add

203
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Multiple components into one package

204
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:22,367
It's just because we at VBM

205
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:24,927
Are distributing one component at a time

206
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,487
That's why there's only one component in the package

207
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,535
But in in

208
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
Integrated perspective

209
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
You can actually import a backup package

210
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,191
Right here

211
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
And that would be

212
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,495
Then everything

213
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
That you have done

214
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,919
So in my case all the components I've build are actually zipped in a backup patch package

215
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,271
And I can import all of those into JCB at once at the moment

216
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:54,367
I've tested it up to at least 20 components which is

217
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,183
It takes a while but it and actually gets there

218
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
Ok so at this point

219
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Everything looks fine

220
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,791
And you can click continue

221
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,375
This depending on the size of the component

222
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,423
All the size of package

223
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
Might take longer and shorter

224
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
And I would just suggest that you wait it out

225
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Take a sip

226
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Coffee or something

227
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,943
It it does take a while because literally at this point

228
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
It is updating the IDs

229
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,015
Everyone

230
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:23,039
One at a time

231
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
So with every field the IDs are being updated with

232
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,255
Every view and everywhere that ID in any other ID is being used anywhere across the component

233
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,559
Everything is dynamically being updated

234
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
During this process

235
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
And

236
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:39,167
So as you can expect it is a lot of

237
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,447
Compilation

238
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Lot of algorithm

239
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,519
Lot of things happening under the hood

240
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:46,591
And therefore does take a little bit longer than

241
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
You might expect

242
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,663
Because the ID is changed

243
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,223
And the way we in export the package

244
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:53,247
Is literally

245
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,599
Just taking a photocopy of the package as it is in the JCB where it was

246
00:08:57,855 --> 00:08:58,367
Develop

247
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,903
Or when it resides

248
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,023
And when you imported we now recreate and remap every ID

249
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,655
To ensure that it remains functional although basically all it's identifiers

250
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
have changed

251
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:16,543
Ok so just wait and in the moment it will show you that it's been successful

252
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,615
But it does take a while

253
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
Once it's done

254
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
You get this

255
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
Longest especially if it was JCB

256
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,527
Which you've imported

257
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
I mean it's a long list

258
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
It has over 1000 field so

259
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,975
You can anticipate a long scroll

260
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
I'm gonna grab this

261
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
thing here

262
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
and drag it

263
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,863
And it goes and goes and goes

264
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:41,631
And it's

265
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
Huge

266
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,007
But they're very much at the bottom you start seeing different things

267
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:49,823
Like the files every little file that has been

268
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:50,591
Imported

269
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,383
And that's really helpful

270
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
If you are importing a package

271
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,735
From a developer which you do not

272
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
No or

273
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,295
You're not absolutely sure you can

274
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Trust

275
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
The now you must check

276
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,695
Every one of these Fields that they are legitimately related to this component

277
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:08,255
And that it is actually what you

278
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:09,023
anticipated

279
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,047
Or expected

280
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,399
And you can also Therefore go look at these folders

281
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:16,191
They are all related

282
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,471
The custom folder

283
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
At the moment as we scroll and now here

284
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:20,799
Are some

285
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:24,383
Folders that are related to the administrator

286
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
VDM compiler

287
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,711
Yes

288
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,783
This is in the compiler so there's a lot of files for the 

289
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
compiler

290
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,087
Joomla 3

291
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,623
Then for the helper this

292
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,183
This little thing here is just like a

293
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
Spacer really

294
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,255
By which we sort of

295
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
Create the string

296
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:47,167
And so there you get all the files that have been moved into place and low and behold

297
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:50,239
There is component builder the fully mapped

298
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Package

299
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
In your system

300
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
And that's really as simple as it is to get

301
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,895
The component that

302
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,663
You need

303
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Fully mapped

304
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,223
Into your system

305
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
And as you can see

306
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
All it's

307
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,575
Views are correctly mapped in here

308
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,135
And if you open any of those views

309
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,951
you'll again see that all it's fields

310
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Are also

311
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Correctly

312
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Mapped

313
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
And

314
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,143
You do realize that every one of these Fields their IDs have changed

315
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
And even

316
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,703
The fields

317
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,983
They again

318
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,263
Have field types

319
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
And even those

320
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Might have changed

321
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,103
The field types

322
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Itself

323
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
And so

324
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Down to the very

325
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
Smallest detail we've tried

326
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
To make sure that every little thing

327
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,063
All across the board

328
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
is remapped

329
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
And

330
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
You know

331
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:41,695
Fixed so that your component is again

332
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,767
Fully Active and stable ready for further development

333
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:51,935
Ok so that is the quick tutorial on how to import a JCB package into JCB. Ok thanks for watching.
