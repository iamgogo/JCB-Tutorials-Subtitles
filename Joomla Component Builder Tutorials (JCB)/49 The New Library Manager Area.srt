1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,840
I'm very excited to announce the

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
Actual

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,960
Library manager implementation

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:14,848
We're busy with a pull request we should have it released within the next hour or so

5
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,480
I'm very excited about this, this new improvement

6
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:22,016
Is really gonna make

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,344
Libraries very Dynamic in JCB

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
Not it has not been dynamic

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,184
It's just

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:33,024
Not everybody realizes how easy it is to add new libraries

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
So

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:36,352
What I wanna do is quickly

13
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,192
Not to elaborate , show you how it used to be done

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,728
And then

15
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:48,128
I want to jump into how it work now and you'll see why the new implementation is so much easier

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,176
So much better and

17
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:51,968
I think everybody's gonna enjoy it

18
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Ok so let's get started on how it used to work

19
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,904
So if we go to a component and we open a component

20
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,536
There are three libraries that are already built into JCB that just works out of the box

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:09,632
And those three libraries can be selected

22
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:13,472
With the add UI kit add food table

23
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
Ok

24
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
Let me see

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,640
The other libraries that are being added

26
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,688
Is when detects

27
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,528
Basically some code in the certain areas of the script

28
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:29,088
I'm not gonna elaborate on that, it's going to take too long

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,416
Point is this two you could select here simply

30
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
By selecting

31
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,280
You know now there's a new feature called dynamic

32
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:40,864
And that is part of what we will need to look at

33
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,888
Dynamic

34
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
Basically means

35
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,032
That it is added in on the basis of the views

36
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
That are linked to the component

37
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:56,992
So The Old Way You had to come to the component and sort of tell it here ok , I want UiKit and I want food

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
 table added

39
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,856
And you could tell him you know what version you would like

40
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:07,232
Or if you want it with the UiKit you could actually set that it adds both versions

41
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,888
Now with improvements you'd set this to Dynamic which basically turns off

42
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,168
The

43
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
Global adding of the Uikit component

44
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
And then Falls back

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,408
Onto the new implementation which I will demonstrate with in a moment

46
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,736
So let's leave it on this the way it was

47
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:33,600
That was the first way of actually implementing some library

48
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:34,880
The second way

49
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:38,464
Which was the way that you could now scale it

50
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Is if you want to go to settings

51
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,864
There is component files and folders that you could add

52
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:50,240
So you could click here and say you know what I want to add a 

53
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,312
library that isn't already part of JCB

54
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,896
Ok so let's say you wanted to add Bootstrap

55
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
So

56
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,088
You would say ok there is a folder in your component on the administrator components

57
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
Component Builder custom

58
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
And inside that folder you would place the folder

59
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
For Bootstrap so I don't have it here

60
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Let me quickly do that

61
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,264
Just now I'm gonna refresh this page I

62
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:27,104
I quickly went and added a folder to this custom folder

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
Called Bootstrap

64
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:30,432
So let me just refresh this

65
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
So I'm gonna get in click here

66
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,576
And then there we have it, select Bootstrap

67
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:39,904
I want Bootstrap to be added to the media folder

68
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:42,208
And since we do not do any

69
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,560
Changing of the folder name will just leave that as it is

70
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,400
So basically I move this folder into the media folder

71
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,960
That's the way you would have done that in the past

72
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
So close

73
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:55,776
Now

74
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:59,104
Having added the files to the component

75
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
You will then

76
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,944
Actually have to go to the view

77
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
So if we go to site view

78
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,040
And this looks View

79
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
You will have to in the looks view

80
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,904
you know set

81
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
That it actually now uses

82
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:19,071
Now this is the new implementations I'm gonna undo that

83
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:23,167
And just say Ok in the custom document script area

84
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
You would add this snippet in here so you add a script now you know

85
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
 that you add the the Bootstrap 4

86
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,967
Folder to media

87
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,527
But when it gets installed to Joomla

88
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
It actually a creates a component folder and put the

89
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,135
A files in there

90
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791
If you do not know how that will work out add the folder install it onto Joomla website and go look in the media folder

91
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,583
To get the correct path here

92
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:57,727
And save and close and that's how you would in the past have extended JCB

93
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,263
To actually use

94
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
Other libraries then what's built into JCP

95
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:09,503
And ok I Illustrated that simply so you'll know that we could have done this before

96
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:13,087
But it was a little bit more complicated

97
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:15,903
As the way it's going to work now

98
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,695
So now

99
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
With the new changes we've made

100
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
You can actually

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Remove

102
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:23,839
The

103
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,399
The files

104
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,983
If you have done this this manual way

105
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
You can actually remove these files

106
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,335
So close

107
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,943
You don't need to add them any this way anymore

108
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,503
They will be added in another way now

109
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
I'm gonna demonstrate the other way

110
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,719
By actually starting at the libraries area

111
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,791
Some closing out of the component

112
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
I'm going to libraries

113
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
And you see that with the upgrade

114
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:02,239
There's now a Bootstrap 4 library ,Uikit 3

115
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,263
2,

116
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,335
Food table 2 and 3 and a No Library

117
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,967
Which is really only necessary when you create a snippet which doesn't belong to any library

118
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,271
Just your own snippet that you want to use

119
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
So

120
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,391
The Snippets are now directly linked to these libraries

121
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
These libraries

122
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
These six which been 

123
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,815
 shipped with JCB 

124
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
Should not be changed

125
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,911
In relation to its name

126
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,191
Or it's type

127
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,007
But you can change its behavior

128
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:38,079
now the behavior is the file behavior

129
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,407
There are an a various file behaviors

130
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,223
Let's open Bootstrap to show you some of those

131
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
The moment Bootstrap is set on always add

132
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:52,159
And it is linking in basically a

133
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
Content distributed

134
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
Network link

135
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:00,351
And it says that it it should add it as a link

136
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,447
Now you can change that you can say no I don't want to add it as a link

137
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:07,007
And you can edit this

138
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,543
And

139
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:09,567
Without

140
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,919
Making any changes to the link you can change this to

141
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:15,199
A local

142
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,015
And that what JCP will then do

143
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,111
Is during compilation he will download these files

144
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,951
And add them into the component as local files

145
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,791
Which would then be used instead as the link

146
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
Which I think is quite nice

147
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:36,447
You could also do the same thing here as we did previously you could add

148
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:40,031
Files from the same custom folder

149
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,847
And also folders

150
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,639
Those are

151
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,455
The same kind of implementation except

152
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
It's now done on a library level

153
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:55,135
So that even library gets added to a view as I will show you in the moment

154
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:58,463
You automatically use this

155
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,999
Files

156
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
So that means

157
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,583
You don't need to do it per component

158
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:08,191
You basically do it per library and as you link the libraries to Views

159
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:13,823
It'll automatically incorporate these files into your component which makes it a little bit

160
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
Less effort you just set it up once

161
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,199
And thereafter you could just reuse, reuse

162
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
Do I'm gonna change this to local

163
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,063
So now it will says local get

164
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:30,463
There is an a few behaviours year there is a conditional custom script and do not add

165
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Now the conditional

166
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:34,303
Is still under development

167
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,447
All its functionality is already here so you'll see all the links are showing up here

168
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,823
But as related to its implementation in the compiler

169
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,103
It's not ready yet

170
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
So for now

171
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:55,039
Skip the conditionals option until you see that when you compile that it doesn't give you a warning at

172
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
This moment

173
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,599
If you compile JCB

174
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
Your give you a warning that the conditional options are not available yet

175
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,791
I'm in fact we're planning to have them released with the next release

176
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
Which would be 2.6 point 7

177
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:14,495
So any any version if you looking at this tutorial after 2.6 - 7

178
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
Then the conditional options already working

179
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
So I'm gonna just demonstrate it briefly

180
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
The conditional options works in two ways

181
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,319
the one is you first need to add some configuration fields

182
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
now configuration fields

183
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,439
Is basically Fields that will be added to the global

184
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,231
Options of the component

185
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
And if those fields are tripped

186
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,119
It will have an effect on whatever way you set it

187
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
So to show you that

188
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:46,495
If you look here you'd see there is an options area

189
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,799
If we click on the options area

190
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,431
That's now in a component you would see there is Uikit2 settings

191
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
And it has a bunch of

192
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Buttons here

193
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
That's basically the kind of buttons

194
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:01,599
That you can build

195
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
So you first go and create the fields in JCB as you would normally create any other field

196
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,399
And then in the library come here and click on getting the configuration fields

197
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
So

198
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
Here I'm just gonna select the anything so I'm just gonna say

199
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,335
Add more maybe as an option

200
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,639
And I want to

201
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
Created under the tab called

202
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:29,503
Boot....

203
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
strap

204
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
Just like that

205
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
So that's gonna be the tab name

206
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:37,695
That's gonna be the the the radio button

207
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,999
Save and close just as a demonstration

208
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,095
So now if I change this to configuration

209
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,471
And I click on adding a configuration and then I say

210
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
I want to add the local

211
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,311
These two local files

212
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,359
I want them to be included

213
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,175
When add more is said to

214
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
Yes

215
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:01,247
That's basically

216
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,087
How this configuration of conditions will work

217
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,647
In a relationship so

218
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,231
You won't see any option Fields if you haven't created

219
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,767
Option fields

220
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
In the configuration

221
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
So if you wanna use this area when it is eventually ready

222
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:23,775
You will have an include and exclude option

223
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,567
Based on buttons

224
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,895
And then you select the files you that you want to

225
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
Be added or

226
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
Not not be added

227
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Based on these selections

228
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,623
Now these buttons obviously as part of your component parameters

229
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:43,743
And so within your code when you start developing your templates and your layouts

230
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,559
You can draw upon 

231
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,095
These parameters

232
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,375
In your PHP

233
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,727
And say ok if it's the switch is that then I want this

234
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
HTML to load

235
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,591
Otherwise I want that HTML to load

236
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,919
So you could have Bootstrap alongside Uikit

237
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:04,223
With the same implementation

238
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
So that is giving a idea of where this conditional

239
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,111
Area is supposed to come into play

240
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
The area that I have really like more is actually the custom scripting area

241
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Which really

242
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
Is giving us the same behaviour as what we did in the site view right

243
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,799
So we basically just add the same

244
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,079
Files here

245
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
And

246
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,967
The only thing will change it will add

247
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:41,855
Component 

248
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:43,135
Like that

249
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,439
Wherever we have the component name

250
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,535
Because we want this to be Dynamic or that needs to be

251
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Three of those

252
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
So that if it gets added to any component

253
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
You'll dynamically update those names

254
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
As related to

255
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,847
The fact that it will use Bootstrap version 4

256
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
It really is using this name here

257
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
And it's putting a little - between them and making it lowercase

258
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
And

259
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,063
These two files

260
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:17,951
Are based upon those names there so you basically need to use that name

261
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
And

262
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:19,999
That name

263
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:24,095
And it will dynamically detect that this is a CSS file

264
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,215
I put it in a CSS folder and same the same goes with the JS a file

265
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,335
So basically this is how you do a custom scripting for Bootstrap 4

266
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,455
And that will be very similar to Always Add

267
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,807
Because Always Add would basically write that script for you

268
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,159
And so you just Add the files you always want to add

269
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,975
And the behaviour is like this so

270
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,839
Really I'm trying to give you as much Liberty as possible

271
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:59,679
So that you can use libraries in any way you're like

272
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,983
Write your own conditions

273
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:06,847
Or your own custom script or just let JCB add it always

274
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
Now

275
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,711
I'm gonna demonstrate how this adding always is gonna work in a moment

276
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
Can I save and close out of here

277
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,903
So we have basically Bootstrap Always Add and Uikit Always Add

278
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,183
And Uikit

279
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:27,839
Version 2 we using a built-in option as same for the food table and the food table Version 3

280
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:32,191
So the Build-in options are only available for these

281
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:35,775
1 2 3 4 libraries

282
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:38,591
Not for Bootstrap but for those 4 libraries

283
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,991
And any other libraries that you add will not have a Built-in option unless we build one and then it will become available

284
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,855
Ok so that is showing all around the libraries now

285
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:54,463
Let's link the library to a view so I'm gonna go to site view

286
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
I'm gonna go and open looks

287
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,071
As the site view

288
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,143
And basically I'm just gonna select Bootstrap 4

289
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:06,751
That's all the moment I select Bootstrap 4 the Snippets

290
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,359
That will show up here will then be the Bootstrap 4 Snippets

291
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,687
Since we do not anymore ship

292
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Snippets with JCB

293
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,295
You'll have to install some Snippets

294
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,087
So let me show you that quickly

295
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,671
You go to Snippets

296
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:31,071
 you don't really need to go to snippets. Ok, so the Uikit Snippets are still being shipped

297
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:34,655
But not the Bootstrap 4 Snippets

298
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,215
You then click on get Snippets

299
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,007
Select Bootstrap 4

300
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,663
And it will then load all the Bootstrap 4 Snippets that are available to the community

301
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:48,735
You can deny the user bulk import

302
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Or you could import individual Snippets

303
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,087
for Bootstrap 4

304
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,463
Once it's ready it will show you which ones are new

305
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
So let's I'm gonna add

306
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
That snippet

307
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Say yes I wanna do that

308
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,423
So it's basically installing it

309
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,495
And then I'm also gonna take that one

310
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:14,591
It says would you like to add it too? say yes ok

311
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:19,199
 so I've install to Bootstrap Snippets

312
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,783
The way to install all of them since there's so many

313
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,599
Is the use the bulk option

314
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,903
So you could actually come here to bulk

315
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:34,815
And you see that it has the new and you can click on this and it will install all of the the Bootstrap snippets

316
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Ok

317
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,191
So that is the quick way of getting libraries

318
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:42,495
Snippets into your system

319
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
And installing them

320
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,895
Just by clicking on

321
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,431
On get snippet

322
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:53,503
And it will basically do that for you

323
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,319
Now let's go back to site views

324
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
And again open the looks area

325
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
So now if I select

326
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Bootstrap

327
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,839
Then you'll see those two Snippets that I've installed

328
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
And I can

329
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,983
Click between them and really that's just for you to get the snippet

330
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:16,799
And to be able to add it into your

331
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
You know into your code

332
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,407
Where ever you would like it to be like that

333
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,199
Ok so

334
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
I'm gonna do that

335
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,527
I'm just gonna demonstrate

336
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,599
Adding the library so selecting the library here

337
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,695
Is what will add the library to the component and actually to this view

338
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,487
So you can select

339
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
Multiple libraries for one View

340
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:44,191
But there could be a problem with that if you for example want Uikit version 2 and Uikit

341
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,543
 Version 3 on this page but you want to have it

342
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:54,687
Only use the one or the other based on certain switches in the global options of the component

343
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:55,967
Now

344
00:17:57,247 --> 00:18:00,319
Uikit version 2 was set to fall back to

345
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,111
 the internal

346
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,903
Build-in option

347
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,231
And Uikit Version 3 was said to fall back

348
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:07,999
to

349
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
Always add

350
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
So if we just look at that

351
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,679
Ok so that's Always Add and Built-in

352
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
Now you want to

353
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:21,311
Actually have both libraries under the page

354
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,431
But you wanted to work within some custom implementation the way to do that

355
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
is to click on new

356
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,551
And use the bundle option

357
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:32,831
Select

358
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,623
Those two libraries

359
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
Like that

360
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,999
Decide how you want to do it so it will be possibly a custom script

361
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,303
Or it will be a conditional one

362
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:44,863
Which you will then have to create

363
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
Obviously let me just say this

364
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
So we could call those Uikit

365
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
Bundle

366
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Let's call it Uikit like that

367
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,391
And save

368
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,439
Now

369
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,487
Once you've saved it once

370
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:16,095
You should now add the actual files

371
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,143
So

372
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,703
You would go to folders

373
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,495
And then

374
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:27,615
At Uikit 3.... wrong button

375
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Uikit

376
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,831
3 and Uikit 2

377
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
.........

378
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,487
And you wanna add them to the media folder

379
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
So

380
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:52,447
You'll have to still link the files remember selecting those libraries

381
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,239
Doesn't inherently

382
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,311
 clone it's

383
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Files

384
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:03,711
You'll need to still manually add the files so now we've got version 3......

385
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,015
Why is this so difficult

386
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
here we go

387
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,599
The screens not working along here

388
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
Ok you like it Version 3 and version 2

389
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,719
And save and close

390
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,535
So now

391
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
We have

392
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,351
The files

393
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,191
And here they are as folders

394
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:27,775
And it shows you all the files and folders

395
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,895
That are found inside of those two folders that you've added

396
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
So

397
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:39,551
Yeah I think it's little difficult you cannot see which version is which here

398
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,087
This might be a

399
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
A good option to add

400
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,695
Maybe the folder the name here

401
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
I think that will be

402
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:49,791
In the next release we will make that change

403
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,447
But I think the other option which is also ideal for this kind of implementation is a custom scripting

404
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:58,751
Which you could still create

405
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:02,079
The the the configed files

406
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
Fields excuse me

407
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:08,223
So when it when it's this Uikit version 2 is selected

408
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:12,063
it will load the Uikit version 2 files

409
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,903
But you must understand if you create the buttons

410
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:19,488
 it will be added to the component

411
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,792
But if you use custom script

412
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:25,376
And in here in the behaviour you write the custom script

413
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
You need to

414
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:29,216
Let me just show you in the file

415
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
So in the file

416
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,640
You see that it actually puts the parameters

417
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:39,200
In params this params

418
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,480
So

419
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
You will need to down here

420
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:44,064
Get

421
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
The Uikit

422
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,672
The switch the the button name

423
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,464
That you now

424
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,792
Have created to the configed fields

425
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,376
You then get the value put it into a variable

426
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,680
And then based on that variable

427
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,472
You would either

428
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:04,288
Add the file or not add the file

429
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,872
So you'll basically write this script

430
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
If I was to

431
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,712
Just copy this is an example

432
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
All the way up there

433
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,880
And go here paste

434
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:22,464
This is basically what the custom script should look like

435
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,536
But that means that you created

436
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:30,656
In the library config you created buttons

437
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,704
With those names right

438
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:37,568
And that the values are related to these values here

439
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,384
The HeaderCheck option

440
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,432
Is something that if you

441
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:48,832
 go into the file you go look at the PHP you might understand how to

442
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Use this

443
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,928
And so the HeaderCheck at this stage always being loaded

444
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:58,304
If you don't wanna use the edit check then you just you know just don't use it

445
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,680
But you could go and and try and figure out how the HeaderCheck works

446
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,472
And then use it

447
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,520
 anyway so that is

448
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
Making a bundle

449
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,640
Now let me save this as an example

450
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
And so now we got this Uikit

451
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:16,992
And it's a bundle

452
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:19,040
If we go back to the site View

453
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,856
And we open that up again

454
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:27,232
We will now instead of creating this one and that one we will just create

455
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,048
Select that bundle instead

456
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,096
And that bundle will give me

457
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:38,496
Uikit version 2 snippets it and if we have any version 3 snippets installed

458
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:40,544
it will also load that for me

459
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,616
So I will be able to work with both libraries

460
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
Why selecting is bundled

461
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:49,760
Library option and JCB when it compiles

462
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:54,880
He will basically use the custom script that you wrote in the Bundler

463
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,232
To add it to the view so let me

464
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
Show you that so I'll save and close here

465
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,632
And let's go back to the library quickly

466
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
And just do something silly to the code

467
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,312
So that you will actually see it's implementation

468
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,848
I am just gonna add

469
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
These bunch of lines here

470
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,176
Save and close

471
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
And then let's compile this

472
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
and install

473
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,512
Ok let's look at the code

474
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,168
So now you see that it's added in this library files

475
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,728
Obviously it's also added in

476
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,264
The

477
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,056
Originals because

478
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:50,176
We haven't set that button to show let me just show you 

479
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:50,944
What I mean

480
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
In the component

481
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,832
You need to change the version

482
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,928
Of the old library implementation

483
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,976
You need to change that

484
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
So now

485
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,840
You need to change this from adding Uikit version 2

486
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,888
To basically to dynamic

487
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,192
Save and close

488
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,544
No if we compile it now you will see it will not add the

489
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
That 

490
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:19,104
Code

491
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
To the file twice

492
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:25,248
You're basically just add that Uikit bundled

493
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,040
Code that we wrote

494
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,344
Ok let's look at the code

495
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
So now

496
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:37,792
We see that it only added the code that we wrote

497
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
And then

498
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:44,192
Remember in the file we added this as custom script

499
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,496
So we need to go remove this

500
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,056
In the 

501
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,336
View

502
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
Where we added this in

503
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,712
So in the view we added these custom script

504
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,016
We actually didn't need to add the spaces

505
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:03,648
And we do have a little bit of a

506
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
A discrepancy there

507
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,840
Ok I'm gonna escape this just that you can see

508
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:15,680
We don't need to add this in this way anymore

509
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
We can go here

510
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
And

511
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,544
Basically

512
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
do that

513
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
we still want that

514
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,296
Bundler in there as well

515
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,368
Ok so we don't need to do this anymore

516
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,648
We can just

517
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Basically select Bootstrap

518
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
Save and close

519
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,304
And then I'm gonna run the compiler again

520
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,008
There we go

521
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:57,664
If you look at it hear we see that there is that escaped code that we removed

522
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,016
And here is this code that JCB added

523
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
remember I said to you that

524
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,112
We basically in JCB

525
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,928
We are Linked in

526
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,512
If we look at the library might not here

527
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,048
Let's go here

528
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:19,168
The Bootstrap 4 library we set Always Add

529
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,800
And we basically linking it from a link right and we just said local get

530
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,104
Now if we look at the code

531
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
We see that it

532
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
wrote

533
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
For us this

534
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,224
Path

535
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:37,088
So now let's check if it actually did add the path correctly

536
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,952
So we wanna go to the media area of the

537
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Program

538
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
And go to

539
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
.........

540
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
Demo

541
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
And so

542
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,520
We see it created the Bootstrap folder

543
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,568
And added the files

544
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,616
According to the path

545
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:06,016
That it also set here so that it is really implementing the get

546
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,040
Option

547
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,832
For the libraries

548
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,208
And all you really did is you just linked it to this view

549
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,816
This does give another situation where

550
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:23,424
To every view that you want is pacifically library to be available

551
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,704
You need to link it

552
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,984
To that View

553
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,032
Which wouldn't be a problem

554
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:34,432
If you created a view now and just add your library and then add the Snippets

555
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:40,576
Then I mean then you're starting a fresh and you will actually select the right views you want to use

556
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:46,720
But if you since you haven't done this before all the components

557
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,048
If you wanna use a library in the view

558
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,096
You have to go and add it

559
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:54,656
Or you just have to

560
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:57,728
Basically in the components area fall back

561
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
On the old way of implementing

562
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:07,200
The the libraries that are built into JCB so that means the old implementation still work

563
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,760
If you

564
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:12,576
If you basically set it here

565
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
to

566
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,976
Add both Uikit version 1 and 2 and 3

567
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
And also

568
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:23,328
Maybe to add food table version 2

569
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
those

570
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,656
Implementations still work

571
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:31,776
And doing that will add it to every custom and admin view where it's used

572
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Sorry

573
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:38,176
Custom insite view custom admin view site view template layouts

574
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:45,088
So that that's the old way and that still works it's just that when you want to start using like

575
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,368
Bootstrap 4

576
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:52,768
You'll have to actually link it to the custom admin view or site view or template layout

577
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,048
Where you want

578
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,584
That specific

579
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
 library to be available

580
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
So

581
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:02,496
View link in Bootstrap over here

582
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:08,896
Then it will be available to this layout and to every view where this layout is

583
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:09,664
Used

584
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,272
Ok so that's the quick and demonstration of the new

585
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
Libraries implementation

586
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,880
We call it a library manager

587
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:24,256
Because of The Diverse ways of you linking in the files and so forth

588
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:26,560
We really hope that you

589
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:32,192
Understood then are able to enjoy this new implementation

590
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,984
We want to

591
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,056
Make it possible for you to add libraries

592
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,872
And then basically share that snippets

593
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
With the rest the community

594
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
So those of you that interested in doing that

595
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,832
Please watch some of the previous tutorials about Snippets and the snippet manager

596
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:50,112
Because

597
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
I think doing this will not only help everyone else in the community but also get your name

598
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
I'm out there

599
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,840
I get people connected with with each other

600
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
Anyway

601
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,400
Thank you for watching
