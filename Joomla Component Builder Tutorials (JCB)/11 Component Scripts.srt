00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:02,816
So we just looked at

3
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,840
Settings

4
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,120
Of your component

5
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,704
And now next we be looking at the scripts tab

6
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,520
Here is an area where you most probably

7
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,312
Add a lot of custom scripting

8
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
So this area is focused on giving you

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,664
Area you know

10
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,712
Interface to add custom

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:22,528
Scripting to your component in a global way

12
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,600
So obviously you can have custom scripting per

13
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
per Admin

14
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:28,416
Sorry per admin backend view

15
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:31,488
But you can also do that within the global scope with

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,768
Regards to many

17
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,048
certain values

18
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,376
The the one thing that is

19
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,912
Nice to have here is

20
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
You can add

21
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,752
Create user helper method

22
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:44,032
To the component

23
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,872
Now the user helper method is simply code

24
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,016
If you do not know how to write php this method will be of no use to you at all

25
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
But if you do

26
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
Then this this method will come in very handy

27
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,160
Let me illustrate that to you

28
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,024
If you click this yes I have a component in which I've already

29
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,816
Implemented This feature

30
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
And it's called

31
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,632
The cost-benefit projection tool

32
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
Now if you click on companies

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,776
You can actually

34
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,056
Click new

35
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,384
And then

36
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,712
It has an area for you to create a company

37
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,600
And ideally you would connect that company to a user in the system

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,952
But if you don't add that company to a user

39
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,512
Because a user can have multiple companies

40
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,536
So that's why

41
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
If you click on this tab

42
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,352
You could select the user

43
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:46,496
But if you haven't selected a user and you've entered an email address and a name

44
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Then

45
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,104
And also the needed information of course

46
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
Then you will

47
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,968
Once you click save

48
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
Close or save

49
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:00,576
The system will actually create a user for you

50
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,672
An automatically email the user details to that user

51
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,792
And that is because of that specific helper class that I

52
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Added

53
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
So

54
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Ticking helper class

55
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
Now obviously it doesn't do it

56
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:17,216
On its own

57
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
You need to write the code for it

58
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
So let me show you where I did it

59
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
In the controller

60
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
You have an area

61
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,968
if we open up company

62
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
You have an area called Post safe

63
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:36,416
OK it's this one here

64
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
Is the postsaveHook

65
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Remember

66
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
When we'd looking at the admin views

67
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
We could target this area in fact that's exactly what I did

68
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
So let me show you

69
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
So I'm in the admin view for company

70
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,032
And if I go to PHP

71
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:55,360
You would see that I have some Ajax there

72
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
And then I have

73
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
Area

74
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
Which is the post safe method

75
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
I need a post safe method

76
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,160
I'm basically checking something some values

77
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
And then when I realized that this user does not exist let me just check here company

78
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,056
Here it is

79
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
If the user does not exist

80
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
Basically I'm doing a check here

81
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:32,224
Then I'm using the helper

82
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,528
No wait that is not the feature

83
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
There it is

84
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,160
Create user

85
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:46,304
So again I've spoken about this placeholder Convention before

86
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,400
I here you are using the brackets Convention not the

87
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,424
Hash one

88
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,264
So three brackets that must be uppercase component

89
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,896
And then I get 3 brackets and helper and this will be replaced with the components code Name

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
Ok so

91
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:05,504
That is what that does and then it basically

92
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,552
Gets the helper class

93
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,832
Create user

94
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:11,648
So in the helper class of this component

95
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
If I close this down

96
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,000
Can I go to the

97
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
helper

98
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:19,071
And I open

99
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
The helper class you see that is the name

100
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,191
So it is the components name

101
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
And then it's called helper

102
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,055
And in helper class there is a

103
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
Feature called

104
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,735
Create user there it is

105
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
So basically it gets an array in it

106
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,159
And that array has some values

107
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,695
Which will be using

108
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,999
Like password 1password 2

109
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
And it will set the password so I'm not gonna explain this code basically just showed you where the function is

110
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
So the function was added to the components helper class and in that script

111
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
I'm simply calling that function after having build the the user

112
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
So I said the erase name and the email is that obviously the function if there is no password

113
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
Set it will set a random password and again use another method

114
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
Which also is part of the helper class we explored it with all helper classes is random

115
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,847
Random method we can get a random string so

116
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
That is creating a user and then it sets up the password and then it gets the

117
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:47,647
Array ready get a model now the model I

118
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:54,047
Got from there get model again we are using a component builder

119
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,911
Custom method which gets the specific model from the system

120
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
And then basically fires the register

121
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:05,567
Method

122
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,359
upon this dataset

123
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
And then

124
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Updates

125
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,991
The parameters for the system

126
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
Regarding this new user

127
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,087
Sends in the email

128
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,671
And then returns the ID because obviously we were looking

129
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
Foreign ID

130
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,231
That's actually what we want

131
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,511
We want to

132
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
I want to get the

133
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,359
there we have the ID

134
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
If we have the ID

135
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
If you don't have the ID will send a message

136
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
To the user

137
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
And if we have the ID will basically store it into that database

138
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
To connect

139
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
That item

140
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415
To that user

141
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,463
Automatically and then click save

142
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,255
Now

143
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
That is

144
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
Custom scripting

145
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
So this little switch

146
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
Is this adding that

147
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
Method to your helper class

148
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:06,239
That's all it does

149
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:11,359
Where as this switch adds the Uikit library to your media

150
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
folder

151
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
As well as integrates

152
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:16,223
it Dynamically

153
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,503
Wherever

154
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
Are you use

155
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,087
The uikit class names

156
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,671
So you won't need to write that any in any custom way

157
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Automatically adds it

158
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,999
The same goes with food table

159
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:32,863
This CSS is global CSS for all the backend views

160
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,143
entire backend

161
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,167
So

162
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:38,239
if You wanna add CSS that would target the whole back end and then you

163
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
do it there

164
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,431
This is a place for you to add your own custom scripting to the helper class the admin helper class

165
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
so as you can see

166
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
I have a whole custom

167
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Scripting here for

168
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,575
Sermon distributor

169
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
For the admin

170
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Area

171
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
And as well

172
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,999
As an event

173
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,071
Now I spoke about this event concept briefly before

174
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,703
But what we want to achieve with the event is basically on every page

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
If you look at

176
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
This sermon distributor

177
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
Back end part of it

178
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,783
It has a file which is the in Main file

179
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
Which Joomla calls first calls sermon distributor

180
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,159
And in that file

181
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:31,231
It basically triggers that Global admin event

182
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,375
And the global admin event is nothing else than a function inside of your helpers

183
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
function

184
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
So it always Triggers

185
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
If you add that switch

186
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
And then it passes at the document object

187
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:48,383
Ok so the document object is being built up here

188
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:53,759
So I'm just passing it over to the global event so we don't need to really clear it there

189
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
So if I was to open the helper class

190
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,599
Which we have here and

191
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,391
Scroll to the top

192
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Then you would see that I have

193
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:06,559
It was the top I was just in the wrong file

194
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,095
It says here

195
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Load Dropbox Ajax

196
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Now

197
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,263
This again it's just another function right so I wrote that function

198
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,383
So you can basically add whatever functions you want to run globally

199
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,175
Every time a page opens

200
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,527
Now that is a way to run it like a Chronicle job

201
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
On the front and the back end of the component

202
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,647
If you have things that you want to be done chronically

203
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,463
This feature is really targeted at doing that

204
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
So

205
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,071
Here we are loading the Drop Box Ajax

206
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,887
So if we go back to the component

207
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:43,423
You see that I am

208
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:44,959
Just adding

209
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:49,567
That script first I just ticked Global admin event yes

210
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,639
And I added that script that's all they added

211
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,991
And that script was taken and placed inside of the global event

212
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,783
The trigger

213
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,831
This trigger is set by

214
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,391
Component builder itself you don't need to write that

215
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,207
It will insert this trigger itself

216
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,511
just because you clicked yes

217
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:13,887
You need to then just Add the script that must run inside of the global event

218
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:16,191
Wich I decided to be another function

219
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
And then this function

220
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
Which I want to run

221
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,567
I added

222
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
To the admin

223
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
View

224
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,247
You see here at the admin helper class

225
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
I added that function here

226
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
So I basically just used

227
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
That name

228
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:40,255
And called it "self" because we inside of that class right so that's how you call

229
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,327
Static class

230
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,607
Method

231
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
And a past the same information because

232
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
In my method

233
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:52,543
I'm adding JavaScript to the dorm right

234
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:58,943
So to the document object so I want that document and then I said add script declaration

235
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:05,343
And simply that means on every page of this component in the back end it adds this little script which then calls

236
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:08,671
By Ajax

237
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
Which I explained previously

238
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,303
And it starts checking the Dropbox listing automatically

239
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,655
So that's an automatic feature I wanted to add to my component

240
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
And this is way that I did it

241
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,847
And then I felt that I wanna add it that you can do this in other components and that's why I added this event switch

242
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,127
Ok

243
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
This event switch here

244
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,343
Ok and then this same goes for the site area

245
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:39,647
I also added that same class

246
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:44,255
You might ask why I have different helper classes for the front and the back

247
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:45,535
Well it's about

248
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
Pretty belt security I suppose and permissions

249
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,983
There are things that I wanted to in the back end which I'm not asking that much questions

250
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
Where on the front I might be more

251
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847
Protective I would suppose

252
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
And

253
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:06,527
So for that reason and implementation also is often different in the front then in the back so that's why we have to

254
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,343
Different files helpers site class

255
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
And the

256
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
Helper admin class

257
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:17,279
And you can add custom scripting as you can see I added that same script to the front

258
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
And I also add it

259
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
A site

260
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:21,375
Event

261
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,935
Which also trigger is that same script

262
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,775
Now you might say well if everybody Triggers The Script

263
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,335
Then it's gonna be running multiple times

264
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Well

265
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,711
That's exactly part of what I did I actually added

266
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
A feature

267
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,807
In the Ajax call

268
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
That logs weather it's already Active

269
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
And if it's Active it just ignores that call

270
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
So

271
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
Basically it has a controller over

272
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,303
Whether it should run or not

273
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,863
Meaning that if it needs to run

274
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,679
Because it even has a timer you see you can set

275
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:01,055
For the Sermon distributor you can set how often you want Dropbox links to be updated

276
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,615
Every day every 2 days

277
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:10,015
And so this Script If it checks wants to update and it's not time it just dies

278
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:16,415
Doesn't do anything so it's very light since it's Ajax you don't the user himself don't

279
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:22,815
Even notice a delay in his page so the page opens as fast as it always do and then fire that

280
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Ajax call to the server

281
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,935
Which starts this whole process on the server

282
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:35,359
So that's primarily what this is all about obviously you need to know programming and you need to know how to secure all that

283
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
And I'm not gonna try and explain that to you now I'm just saying that this is all possible inside of component builder

284
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
Simply through these custom areas you can also add a SQL dump

285
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:56,351
Instead of adding it to the actual views you can export all the views and add them

286
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,447
here and it will be actually added to the same file

287
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,055
And so don't do it twice but this is another area to add

288
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
A SQL dump file

289
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,407
And

290
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Then

291
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,527
We have this nice feature called dashboard methods

292
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
You see

293
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,855
Let me show you what I've done with it

294
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:23,487
Again just that you know all this data that I'm showing you is dummy

295
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,511
Not related

296
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Just me testing it

297
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
So I wanted to add this

298
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,495
Usage statistics to the component so you could see

299
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Which country has done what

300
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
When in what area

301
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,615
So

302
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,735
So I needed to take a lot of different database tables and calculate used by

303
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,831
certain ways in and I wanted to have that on the dashboard

304
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,927
The dashboard really had always icons and so I didn't want it

305
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,255
Add another custom view wish I could have done custom admin view

306
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:00,351
I wanted it simply right there at the moment of the page load

307
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
And so we added that feature

308
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:04,959
Component builder and we called it

309
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
We call that dashboard methods

310
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:15,199
Now let me go to one where I actually implementing it so I could

311
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,271
Spend more time in explaining unless on typing

312
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,111
Ok so here we go

313
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Basically

314
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
I created a

315
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,047
Method called get usage data it's a public function

316
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,327
Public method

317
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,655
And inside it I added my script

318
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,959
And obviously inside of this script

319
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:43,359
I'm calling other methods which I made it made protected so the script that

320
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,407
Must be called from

321
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,759
The dashboard tab I'll show you that at the moment

322
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
You said that up here

323
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,463
So here is the tab and it's HTML so we called the tab

324
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,535
usage statistics and a header we made Table

325
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,839
And here is the HTML

326
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:09,471
Ok which we are using and in the HTML

327
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:15,871
You see that I have PHP and the way we do that is with that convention

328
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:17,919
of Open bracket

329
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
? PHP and Echo and then closing it again there so basically

330
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,719
I'm checking whether the usage data is there

331
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:37,119
Now how do I know that I should target usage this usage data and then items

332
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,959
Well this is a convention this area there

333
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
And the way that that Convention works

334
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
Is

335
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,895
By that one there

336
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
So usage data

337
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,039
Relates to

338
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
Usage data

339
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:59,135
So the moment you add to word get

340
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:05,535
This word get in front of a function it will be

341
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Added

342
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,911
to a Global the result of that Get will be added to this

343
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
And without the Get

344
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
Name so that the convention

345
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:17,055
The convention is you could've called that

346
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
Get

347
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,151
the man on the moon

348
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
Then this would be Man on the Moon

349
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:27,039
This and obviously all lowercase Man on the Moon

350
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,599
So

351
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:31,903
That will be dropped

352
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
And this is gonna be used

353
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Lowercase as the this

354
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,255
So

355
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,119
That's the convention I know it might not be that obvious but it works

356
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,911
So your other functions

357
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,447
If they are protected

358
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,239
Shouldn't have the word get in it

359
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,311
At the moment it's set to

360
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:53,151
Set that as that one is set

361
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
And then this one is

362
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Visit check

363
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
This one is set companies

364
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,879
and set countries

365
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,207
So you can see I could add a lot of PHP in here

366
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:09,023
And all these PHP together

367
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,071
Basically gets the data

368
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
That we want on the page

369
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,167
And when I get the data I placed it

370
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,983
In what is seen as the item

371
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
Ok

372
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,943
Oh you know what let me see set statistics return this statistics

373
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:37,183
Ok so

374
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:43,583
I'm returning a field here or a a method value

375
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:49,215
And this method value is being populated in this sub functions

376
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,751
And in one of them

377
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
It is adding

378
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
Over here

379
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,639
The name items as a

380
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:59,455
a Pointer

381
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,015
So it becomes an object

382
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Well it is an object in fact I

383
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:06,367
Think I set it is an object up here there we go

384
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,927
And

385
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,071
There I look through the companies and as I look through them I'm busy totalling and adding and going on

386
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,351
I guess so

387
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
I'm not going explain the code itself

388
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,983
But basically this is getting returned

389
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,775
And because he's an object

390
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
If I look here

391
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,919
I'm able to Target items as an object

392
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
And then if it's exist

393
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:39,135
And if it's set I start looping through items and certain places I'm using totals and

394
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
Different values so that is just adding some of that data to the page

395
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:49,119
And this area here

396
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:55,519
Now I could have made this much simpler right so maybe not look that intense to you but this could have been a simple

397
00:19:55,775 --> 00:20:01,919
Class in fact you could have let this out completely and just put a

398
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,223
Comment so you could have done this

399
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:10,623
Because it's gonna scream at you for you know this is if you see is not compulsory so you can set is

400
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:17,023
Not needed and then in here you could just do HTML so if you just wanna give information

401
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:21,631
To the user about who made the component maybe or some

402
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959
would like to run a rss feed here you could have done it right here

403
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:31,359
Ok I'm just showing you that you can reach into PHP here and that the PHP that

404
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,919
you reach in has the convention

405
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
Of dropping the get and then using that front area usage data

406
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,719
To place information in which you can parse in your HTML here that you would do and any other component

407
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:47,487
View

408
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
Ok so that is just quickly looking at the script area of a component

409
00:20:54,143 --> 00:21:00,287
I realize there's so much more to say but I really can't

410
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:06,687
Elaborate too much on this it since it requires skill in in PHP

411
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:13,087
It's something that I think will only become very useful if you are a developer as

412
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:15,135
Developed a few components

413
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:21,280
And can then see how you can easily add custom scripting to his component through this

414
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:27,424
Methods ok well next up will look at the ReadMe

415
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,824
And maybe their FTP server concepts. Thanks for watching
