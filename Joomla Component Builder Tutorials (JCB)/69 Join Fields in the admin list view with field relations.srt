1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:05,376
Well I'm happy to announce that we have added a very

2
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:07,424
Long awaited feature

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,704
To JCB

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,288
You need to upgrade to

5
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:14,080
Version 2.8

6
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,128
To actually get this feature

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:18,688
This feature though

8
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
Does effect

9
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:24,064
How JCB builds the Admin View

10
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,600
List View

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,136
So that means

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,928
Basically

13
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,464
These areas

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,768
Where you got list of items

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,864
So if you got custom scripting in your component

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
In these areas

17
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:39,680
The

18
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:43,264
New when you install or upgrade to version 2

19
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:47,616
You would experience that your custom scripting doesn't get added

20
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
you know

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Correctly

22
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,272
We'll still add it will still be added to the document

23
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:59,136
But you have to go and move it into the correct place and an commented and

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,696
You know do the

25
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,232
replacement of the code

26
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,048
Add those diamonds to

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,120
Notify JCB to update the placement

28
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
So that's

29
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,776
Just a heads up because the list views are

30
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,568
Improved actually

31
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,616
The way it's being built

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,688
The this extra

33
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
Sort of

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,552
Changes to the code snippets changes the fingerprints and all that

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,416
So enough that what the new features is all about is actually

36
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,256
Taking specific values like maybe this value

37
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:38,048
And that value

38
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:41,888
And to combine them into one value into one column

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,520
And yet have the option of still being able to filter with those values

40
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:51,104
Now we forgot this component

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
Sermon Distributor

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:55,968
And I am planning

43
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,016
To take the preachers

44
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
List View

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:04,928
You'll see that it now shows the name and a short description or whatever description you've added

46
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
I want to have it also show

47
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,304
If there is an email address

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
So if this email address is filled in

49
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,680
Then it should show the email address

50
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
Or

51
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,824
If it doesn't find an email address but it finds a

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
Web address it should show the web address

53
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,944
so it should show other one or the other

54
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,272
And it must connected next to the name

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,392
And and I think we'll use that as our demonstration of this feature

56
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:38,464
Ok so now let's go back to component Builder

57
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
And then we would go to

58
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
The admin views

59
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
And

60
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
If you

61
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,008
Or not if you haven't done it yet there won't be an icon showing up anywhere here

62
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,592
But once you've done it there will actually be one I'll show you that

63
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,152
So we will go to the preachers admin View

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,456
So just go to the the one you want to change

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,600
And then under the settings area

66
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Sorry not the settings area

67
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,952
It's the fields area

68
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
You'll see that there is now

69
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,328
A new area called admin

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
Fields relations

71
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
and here at the bottom

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
You'll see a field relations

73
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
So that's the new area that's the new feature

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
You could either click here

75
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,128
Or

76
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,408
You click here

77
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,224
both of them will achieve the same

78
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Taking you to the

79
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,272
Same place

80
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
So I'm the click on this one it's ok

81
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
And then

82
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:42,976
You basically in the admin Fields relations Builder

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,792
so you could click here on adding a

84
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:49,632
Admin fields we gonna set we gonna use the name

85
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,448
And we gonna join that up with the email

86
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
And with the web URL

87
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:58,336
Now will see that there is this area

88
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,616
Column

89
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:02,176
The area column actually

90
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,456
Can

91
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,016
Target three places

92
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,112
Before modelling the value after modelling the value

93
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
And the view

94
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,672
So

95
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,280
If you know I'm what a model is that means the area where you still working

96
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
Just with a code

97
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
Where as in the view

98
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,911
You must think of you already have a

99
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,703
HTML trunk

100
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:26,495
That represents that field

101
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,567
So if I could show you that more

102
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Directly in the code

103
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,735
In first looking here at the folder structure you see I am in

104
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,527
administrator components

105
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,087
Then sermon distributor

106
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,647
Then here's the views and here's the models

107
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,463
So if we go to the model of the preacher

108
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:49,535
Plural one because we going to the list View

109
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:50,815
You'll see

110
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
That it has

111
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Items

112
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Now

113
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,495
At the moment there is basically nothing being modelled

114
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,799
Modelled usually would imply

115
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,103
If it is a json object

116
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
And it needs to be taken from json to an array

117
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,759
Or if it's a encrypted value in a needs to be decrypted

118
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
Those kind of things

119
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:17,439
Oh whether you wanna work with the value before that happens or after that has happened

120
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,071
Ok so then if you want a you work with the actual

121
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
Item

122
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:31,007
Where it's still just an integer or a string and really that's all that is

123
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Then you'd target the model

124
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,639
If you wanna target the view

125
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,967
Which in this case if we go to preachers

126
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,039
And then the body

127
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,087
You see that

128
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Basically

129
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
Everything from here

130
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
Up to here

131
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,023
Is representing

132
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,815
The ID

133
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Everything from

134
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
here up to here

135
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,191
Is a presenting the name

136
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:03,775
And so if you wanna target this chunk

137
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
Because it still gets generated

138
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
of course

139
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
Then you would target the view

140
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,503
Because then JCB will still build this whole block for you

141
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,551
Basically this block

142
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:21,951
And you can move this block around and join it with the other block for the other field

143
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
As you like

144
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,071
So that we could be that you didn't have two links

145
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Or that

146
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Yes

147
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:33,215
All kinds of interesting things can happen my best

148
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:37,055
Advice is you know try it out take it for a spin

149
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,127
Make some changes compile it install it

150
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,943
See what's changed go to the areas

151
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Which being

152
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:45,247
either the view

153
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:50,367
Or the model and see the code that was generated based on your selection

154
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
Now we gonna

155
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:58,303
Make multiple changes and show you what will happen so save you some other time and then understand

156
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,327
What's happening

157
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
And so let's go 

158
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
Do it

159
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,239
The first area I'm gonna target is the model area

160
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:11,871
Then it has a joint type which is either a concatenation with

161
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,223
With a glue option the glue option is basically what do you want to be placed

162
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
Between the values

163
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:23,647
You could say no I want them to be completely crank up against each other like that

164
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:28,767
And usually it'll still add a little space it'll still add a little space in

165
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:30,559
And

166
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,655
You can say no I want I want a little Arrow between them

167
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,679
Like that

168
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:41,567
But it's basically a value you want to place between these two values

169
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
Ok so I'm gonna just leave it as a comma for now

170
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
And then save and close

171
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,343
And then also save and close the view

172
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,879
And now you'll see

173
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,695
That there is a new icon here

174
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:01,023
We can click and directly go edit the relation

175
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
So

176
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,351
That is the new icon added

177
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,655
Now if we go to the compiler

178
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,751
We will be able to compile this and see it in action

179
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,031
So I'm not gonna 

180
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,103
Do that just gonna compile sermon distributor

181
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,455
Install it and now

182
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:26,111
First thing is let's open sermon distributor and let's go to the preachers table and 

183
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,903
See how it looks in the interface

184
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
So here we see

185
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,487
It basically adding

186
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,583
Both of them adding the email as well as the

187
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
URL

188
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,751
And because it's exceeding a specific length it is escaping it and we have this little

189
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
Pop-up come up here

190
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,871
It so there's that comma we added as a concatenation

191
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,663
Between the values

192
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,991
So that is really what we expected

193
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:57,087
Let's go back and make some changes

194
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,671
Well let me let me first show you the code that was built

195
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:04,767
So we were targeting the model so basically it just

196
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,303
Add this

197
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,095
As a glue

198
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,655
To glue these values together

199
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,959
Concatenating them

200
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:16,543
Yes

201
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,591
So that was the model now

202
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
Like I said this specific view doesn't have

203
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:28,319
Really any modeling it does to the values So even if I would to say it select after

204
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
It won't necessarily change anything

205
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
Ok so

206
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Let's make another change

207
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,607
Let's instead of using the default glue option

208
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,191
Let's say Ok we wanna do a code option

209
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,031
Then you'll see the JCB cranks out sort of ok

210
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,567
to

211
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
Give you the

212
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:53,919
Freedom to actually write code

213
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
We are using the IDs

214
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Of the fields

215
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,551
In in braces

216
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,623
Curly braces because

217
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Well

218
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,207
Many reasons I'm not gonna

219
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,231
Waste your time

220
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,511
More or less

221
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:14,143
Boils down to the fact that it's difficult to know exactly what the field names gonna be at this point

222
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,239
For every kind of type of field that is there

223
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
So working with the ID just saves us a lot of

224
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,079
Effort

225
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,711
But since it's difficult to know which field is which ID we had this little comment

226
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:34,367
to sort of give you a heads up ok so this value is basically the website this one here is basically the

227
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,135
Email

228
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:39,487
And I would suggest if you are sure of what is what

229
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,839
To just take the comment out because otherwise it'll be added to the code

230
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:45,631
So that is just

231
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:48,191
What I would suggest so this stage we know

232
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,519
That what this is saying is basically what we saw

233
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,103
In the code it is almost exactly the same

234
00:10:55,615 --> 00:11:00,735
Except that it is using numbers here so now we can do some little PHP

235
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,783
So we can say something like this

236
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:05,855
So we basically checking

237
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
If this is not empty

238
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:11,999
Then we use that which is the email otherwise

239
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
we fall back onto the

240
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,327
You know the URL

241
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,423
and when the URL is empty it just means that there will be an empty string

242
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
So maybe that's not that ideal either

243
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
So let's make it a little bit more advance

244
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:31,711
So now it's saying if there is an email use the email otherwise check is there a URL

245
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
No

246
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,575
If there is sure then add it if not then add nothing

247
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:40,159
And it just stays without the comma and everything

248
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
So there we go

249
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Got a little

250
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,743
Adaptation there

251
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:46,815
So just make sure that this Convention is kept

252
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,679
So the Curly braces with the ID and then the closing curly brace

253
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
This will then be updated with the actual name of the field and so you can do full HTML

254
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,663
Sorry PHP coding in this area

255
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:08,319
And it will be implemented that means you could also pass the value to a function which then

256
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
Passes it back to the value

257
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
And this is in the model

258
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:17,279
And this is before modelling and after modelling oo

259
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
That's a

260
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,423
Good thing that happened every time you change anything here

261
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:25,215
It's going to update the code

262
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Because

263
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:30,079
Sometimes it is expected that these two

264
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:36,735
Values might look different at this stage it doesn't but it is a JavaScript that fires on

265
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,039
Changing of any of these fields

266
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
And so I have to type all that over now

267
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,719
So the Best Idea is you wanna make changes here

268
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:49,791
First copy the value in here

269
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,607
And then you can make changes

270
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
And see

271
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
you know what what happens

272
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
And

273
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
Then as you decided what you want

274
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:03,359
You can just paste it back in

275
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
Ok so there we have it

276
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,247
If it doesn't behave exactly right just change it a few times

277
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
We will

278
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,367
Will still tweak the JavaScript here to make sure that it's

279
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
You know working exactly 100 Percent

280
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:18,719
So this is sort of

281
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
Beta phase sort of but it works the

282
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,839
The same functions as it should

283
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,191
It's just that the I'm still ironing out some JavaScript here

284
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
Another thing

285
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
You can only

286
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,055
Target

287
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
The name list field

288
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,407
Once

289
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:41,247
You cannot add it a second time like this

290
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,575
And say ok you're here we gonna do it again

291
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
But now

292
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,671
Using maybe some other values

293
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
To also target it

294
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,743
In some way

295
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:56,863
You cannot do that only one of them will get implemented the other one will be dropped

296
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
It's a limitation I know but believe me

297
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:06,591
This feature as it is now is already really stunning

298
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
And able to achieve quite

299
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Impressive results

300
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,855
Ok so here we have it we've adapted it it will only show an email or a web address

301
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,903
If there is actually one set

302
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,975
And that There is None set it won't show any

303
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:27,583
That's the expected result so let's save this and see it

304
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,863
In action

305
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
So we will compile it

306
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
and install

307
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
So there we have it

308
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,479
The preacher showing up with an email address and that's it

309
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
Let's Create one

310
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,807
Without an email address

311
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,623
So we created one

312
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:52,927
With no email address if you see

313
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:58,303
There's none here let's add a web address let's just close again show you

314
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
Now there is nothing not even a comma

315
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,471
But as you see this now is a link the whole thing is a link

316
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,495
And

317
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,311
That might not be exactly what you

318
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,591
Actually want

319
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Ok let's 

320
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,711
Let's add a web address

321
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
And then save and close

322
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
and so here

323
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,879
Because your web address was a little long

324
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,183
It created a a pop-up

325
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
Now all that can be changed

326
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
But let me just

327
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:31,583
Do something else

328
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Let's use a shorter address

329
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,447
Save and close

330
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,495
And now there you have it

331
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:41,311
That looks more acceptable

332
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
And so it detects now whether there's an email or a web address and if there's none it shows none

333
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:51,551
So that was now with this new combine

334
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
Feature

335
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,695
So let's, let's do something even more interesting

336
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,791
So again we go and open that area clicking this icon

337
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:04,095
This is sort of a shortcut

338
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,191
And now instead of targeting the model

339
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
We gonna target The View

340
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,079
And this is where it really gets interesting

341
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:20,991
Because now this little place holder called field=199

342
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:26,111
Is basically a chunk of code as I explained

343
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Initially in the beginning

344
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
Where we are saying

345
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,743
Ok

346
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
Instead of

347
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,863
Targeting the actual value database value

348
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,983
You are now targeting the produced code which JCB builds

349
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:44,031
The html block

350
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,079
For that specific field

351
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
So

352
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:53,759
We can now also I would also encourage you removing the comment this is the comment that shows you that that is the name

353
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,783
That's the email

354
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,831
And that's the web address

355
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:03,231
So I would also encourage you to once you seen it or just remove it we might at a later stage

356
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:06,559
Take the comment and added underneath the box so that it

357
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,839
Clearly is nowhere

358
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
In the way

359
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:13,471
But it is for you to just sort of know that this chunk

360
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,055
Is for the email and this is for the website

361
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,871
Address ok so again

362
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
I want to add a little bit Dynamic Script here

363
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
But I need to keep in mind that I'm actually in

364
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,623
HTML

365
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,183
So if I wanted to add

366
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
PHP here

367
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:37,023
I actually need to

368
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,583
Do the correct PHP tags

369
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,119
And all the rest of it

370
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Ok

371
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
And that means you can actually

372
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,127
Target the item value

373
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,991
You can remove this and work with the actual item value

374
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:01,599
But this little placeholder will produce the whole

375
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,719
Block of code which if it's going to be a dynamic link

376
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
Or something like that

377
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
It'll produce all of that for you

378
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,607
So if it's a

379
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
If it's an

380
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
A custom field which links to a to another View

381
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,775
Then all of that can still be produced in this

382
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
Sort of dynamic placeholder here

383
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:25,407
But you can remove this all of this and you can

384
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
Yeah have it

385
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Echo out anything

386
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
So which you just have to code of course

387
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
I think

388
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,439
Best to demonstrate is first used in concatenation option

389
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:42,047
And which would just put a break between the values

390
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,839
And then save and close

391
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:48,447
And compile install

392
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,591
So we refresh this area

393
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
And now we see that

394
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,735
This value is a link but the other two

395
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,271
It's actually just text

396
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
And that's exactly

397
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,879
What we wanted to achieve

398
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,695
Going into the code

399
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
We open the body

400
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,279
And you'll see

401
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:15,839
The JCB added the brakes

402
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
There is a break

403
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
There's a break

404
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,215
And there's the chunk of code that JCB build

405
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
So

406
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,311
It really build all of this

407
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
It's still built a link to the preacher

408
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:28,895
And then

409
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,943
It's still built this

410
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,223
As well

411
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:36,831
So if this was going to be a link to another View

412
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,879
It will produce that code

413
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
Checking again the permissions and everything

414
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Which is really what makes

415
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,559
This areas implementation quite exciting

416
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:51,423
Because it still takes care of the hard work of producing

417
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,263
The actual code needed to display the value

418
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,151
If you pick up any behaviours in this new feature that sort of unexpected

419
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:06,015
Then please give us a heads up on Github open an issue

420
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,111
And we will try and address it as quick as we can

421
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,183
Again thank you for watching

422
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
This is the new feature of

423
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Combining

424
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
admin view values

425
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
In a

426
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:21,375
Very easy way

427
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,727
It could have been done previously with some custom scripting

428
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:29,311
But this sort of helps you and I'm sure

429
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:35,967
Makes it easy for you to just select the field you want to Target of course that means

430
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:41,087
You first need to add the fields that you are ready going to show in the list View

431
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:44,415
And then select the field you wanna join to it

432
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:46,719
That's sort of

433
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:50,047
I expected you understood maybe that but

434
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,607
I realize I must mention that separate

435
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:57,727
So that means if we go into the preacher Fields area

436
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
you'll see

437
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:00,799
That

438
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:03,615
We actually just got two Fields the name

439
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,919
As shown in list

440
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
And the description shown in list

441
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:13,087
So here we don't make any changes we don't say that the email and then

442
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Website

443
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,672
Must also show in the list View

444
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
In fact

445
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:21,024
Only the fields that I'm not showing in the list View

446
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,120
Show show in the relationship view as joint options

447
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
So that's just a heads up

448
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,496
What is exciting though as you can

449
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
Actually

450
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
Do a

451
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
a filter

452
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,896
And a

453
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,504
Yeah you can do a filter or a search

454
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,648
On these Fields that are not going to be placed but you know you gonna later select them as relationships

455
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:51,744
And then the end up creating JCB will in upgrading the filter

456
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:55,328
And make it searchable at even if it's a link

457
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
to

458
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:59,936
To another page you can click this to be a link

459
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
And then it will generate the link

460
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:08,384
Which is I think amazing knowing that it's gonna set that all the permissions in place

461
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,664
And everything else

462
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,968
Ok well maybe I should

463
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:13,248
Demonstrate that

464
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,272
Just quickly

465
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:17,856
So here in the sermons area

466
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:22,720
We see that we have a Preacher table and we gotta name table

467
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
So

468
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,304
That means we can actually

469
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,912
We have these two links this one will open the preacher

470
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
As

471
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:34,496
We know

472
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,360
Same as opening it from the preacher list view and then this one's gonna open the sermon

473
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:41,152
So

474
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,992
This is going to be easy because now

475
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:50,112
We can decide Ok we got so many rows here let's Combine the preacher

476
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
With the name row

477
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:54,720
And yet we wanna retain this link

478
00:22:55,232 --> 00:23:00,608
As it is working now and we wanna retain the option to actually filter by

479
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
The preacher

480
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,472
So let's show you how easy it is to do that

481
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:09,056
So we'll go to the sermons list View

482
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,896
or admin viewing and then

483
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:19,296
Also again to the fields and click on create fields relations in this ad o wait before we

484
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:20,064
We do that

485
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,112
I first need to remove

486
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
The preacher

487
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:28,768
From the list so we first gonna go to the

488
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
Where we selected the fields

489
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
That needs to be linked

490
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,376
To the

491
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
List the admin list View

492
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
And the one we want to remove

493
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Is the preacher value

494
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
So it's this one

495
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,896
Sermon preacher we gonna say no

496
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:49,760
Don't add it and when you do that is gonna wipe out all the links that usually

497
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:53,088
Should not be selected if it's not a listview

498
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:55,648
But since we still wanted to be a link

499
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,464
And we still wanted to be a filter

500
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,512
We gonna leave those checked

501
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,816
And then click save and close

502
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:06,144
So now

503
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Getting back to this page

504
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:10,240
And going to Fields we'll see that

505
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,288
The the preacher now

506
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,056
Is

507
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:16,128
No longer going to show the list View

508
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,664
But it's still

509
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Going to be

510
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
A filter in a link

511
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,808
And if you compile now it won't show up at all

512
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:28,672
You still need to now go and select the relations area

513
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,488
click on new

514
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,024
And then select name

515
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
Here

516
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
You would now

517
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,352
Need to select

518
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
The

519
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:39,168
sermon preacher

520
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
And then View

521
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:44,032
And then

522
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:46,592
Well we could either say

523
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,408
We wanna do this ourselves

524
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Or

525
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
We could

526
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,736
Use glue

527
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Which in this case

528
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,856
I'm just gonna use a space

529
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
just an empty space like that

530
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,208
And save and close

531
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
And then we compile

532
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,240
Install

533
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:19,360
And then refresh the sermon page we see that now

534
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,640
They are

535
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:22,688
Two links here

536
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,736
The one is to open the

537
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
Actual

538
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:30,112
Sermon and the other one is opening the

539
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
It's going to open the preacher

540
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:38,048
So if we click on it it still behaves as before the preacher gets opened

541
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
we closed again

542
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,936
And we back here and we still have the preacher filter

543
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Here at the bottom of our page

544
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,032
As we had it before

545
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,312
And so

546
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,616
This is really

547
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,384
Great

548
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,200
We can also then open here

549
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,480
And

550
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,040
All is working as expected

551
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,648
Now as easy as it was

552
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:07,488
To combine these two values into one column

553
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:14,400
While still retaining the actual links and everything surrounding this value having a

554
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Dynamically get the name

555
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,264
Because obviously in the table it's taught the ID only

556
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,896
And now showing it here it means it's actually remapped it in the database so let me show you that

557
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,456
So we open the sermons

558
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,064
Model and we scroll down

559
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:36,672
We'll see here in the the list query

560
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:37,952
It's still

561
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,768
Maps the preacher table in

562
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,048
And

563
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:46,400
Builds the connection on the ID in the preacher

564
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
And still selects

565
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:50,496
The preacher name

566
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,080
Then going to the view of that

567
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
Sermons

568
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
We see if you scroll down

569
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
Here

570
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
It has

571
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
Produced this chunk

572
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Of code

573
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:11,232
For the for the preachers name

574
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,048
And this chunk of code

575
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
For the

576
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:16,864
Sermon name

577
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
So it still does all the

578
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
Producing of the

579
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,848
HTML code and all the permissional checking whether

580
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:28,640
Does this user actually have

581
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,176
The edit permission

582
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
to

583
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,760
To change this value

584
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
Of the specific preacher

585
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,928
So yes and yet it's showing the preacher name

586
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,512
As the linking up in the database was done

587
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
So it's quite exciting

588
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
I really

589
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,680
Hope that you would find it as useful as I am already doing

590
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,336
And like I said if you discover anything not to work as expected

591
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:04,224
Please do contact me and on GitHub open up a issue

592
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,504
And we will

593
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,040
Take it from there. Thanks for watching.
