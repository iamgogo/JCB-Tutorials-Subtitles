1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,792
Would like to

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,096
Show you how to

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,680
Use code across JCB

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:10,496
In a very inherent kind of way

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:17,664
By taking the advantages of a few features that JCB has

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:23,296
Features that most may not know is there or maybe they do but they not seen it's advantage

7
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:27,136
And then recently there actually came up a question

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,416
On the Forum

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,280
By Alex Tings asking

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,048
About

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,864
You know he ask admin views but

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
Generic code that runs in

13
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,752
Multiple admin views and then some of it runs only in specific admin views

14
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:47,616
And how I could how I could speed up the maintenance of this kind of thing

15
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:54,528
So his first question is is the helper admin class the best way to put this code and then is there a way

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:59,648
Keep the direct admin forms functions I wrote separate from these specific ones

17
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
Ok

18
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:06,304
I'm sure some of your might even be listening here and I'll understand exactly what we trying to do

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,680
And I'm not even sure if I'm exactly going to answer this you know

20
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,800
So I'm gonna quickly pull up a docker image of Joomla

21
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,944
I have a docker file there just quickly gonna pull it up

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,992
And then we gonna go and use it

23
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
Ok

24
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
Ok so I've got it up running

25
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,160
I think it's default is user

26
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:38,560
Ok so where in here I'm gonna go to extensions and install

27
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,120
And

28
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,704
Basically add the web tab

29
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,984
The JED

30
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,264
JED

31
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,360
Then type JCB

32
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
and here we have

33
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,736
Description can look at that

34
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
And install

35
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
Sort of getting the

36
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
JCB install from GitHub

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Ok we're done

38
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
Go Joomla component builder we're almost there

39
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,336
Then

40
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
We could

41
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,408
Grab a demo component

42
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,552
If you don't know how to get access to these components just follow this link and

43
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,600
Follow the tutorials

44
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,904
So I'm just gonna get the JCB package

45
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
And then the key that

46
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:43,072
You were send you will add here

47
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
Maybe force and update

48
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,912
 is always good sort of 

49
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
get all your Fields updated

50
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
OK now

51
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Continue

52
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
And within moments we have

53
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
JCB

54
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
Installed on JCB

55
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,064
Now we can start looking at the examples

56
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,112
That's really what I wanted to get to

57
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,952
Because the question is being answered by the demo data

58
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,720
Already

59
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
So

60
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,352
In JCB there we already doing a lot of this multi

61
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
Inheritance structure kind of relationships

62
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,728
And

63
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:27,360
So the best way to sort of demonstrate this is to actually look at JCB itself

64
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,152
OK we're almost there

65
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,968
OK we got JCB

66
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:32,736
Here

67
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,296
Now if we go to custom code

68
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,368
We'll see there's a whole lot of custom code

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
And

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,696
Many of them is this hash

71
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Automation

72
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:46,304
Now we wanna look at this JCB manual option

73
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:50,144
For example let's look at the getviewID

74
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Which is a custom code

75
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,264
Basically that is its name

76
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
This is how you use it

77
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,336
And

78
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
Here

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,896
We are having a view

80
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
Called admin View

81
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
That is using it

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
So if we click on that

83
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,576
Is going to open for us the admin View

84
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:13,696
And when we get here we'll see there is the the code now

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,095
This actually is the I'm using this specific get view ID

86
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
All across my components is just

87
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
It's also being used in JCB

88
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
But it's it's powerful

89
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,615
So I'm using it everywhere

90
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
So that's one way

91
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
To use

92
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,247
A a specific snippet

93
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
Which you add here use the JCB manual

94
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Give the function and name

95
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,255
You could pass values to the function like this

96
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,535
And

97
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
Please read the explanation here

98
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
To how that is done

99
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,423
And the end of the day

100
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:59,775
You can then adapted the value structure for example if

101
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:06,175
If this value here needs to change from instance to instance you can pass it by

102
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,479
This value one

103
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,527
Which that will be arg0

104
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:16,159
And then you can just actually replace this here with

105
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,463
3

106
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:20,511
Then arg0

107
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,327
and 3 again like that

108
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,631
And then you just remember to pass

109
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,167
At least one value

110
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,447
To update

111
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
This value

112
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Where ever you using it

113
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,847
That's one way to use the reuse the scripting

114
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,127
Now the other way

115
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:41,247
Which is the one that actually gets used in the helper class

116
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:44,319
It's like here I got one called get file path

117
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,159
To get file path is also a function

118
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:51,743
Which I am using across my components

119
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,583
It is just also being included in JCB

120
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,167
But many of my components is using get file path

121
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,959
And basically

122
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
It is a little function

123
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:09,407
That I can pass a few parameters to and can consistently give me back a path of where I want to place or get 

124
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,175
files from

125
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Now in the

126
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:14,783
PHP helper there is a function

127
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
And the component itself

128
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,879
That's me here

129
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,671
There is a function called

130
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,743
Helper classes for both admin and site

131
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
So anything you put in here will be not only added to the admin helper class but also to the site

132
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,447
Helper class sort of a way to

133
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
Avoid doing it twice

134
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,775
And

135
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:37,055
As you can see

136
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:39,871
There is one to just put it in the admin

137
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
So you could just take care and just target the admin helper

138
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,039
Or you could just target the site class helper

139
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:51,903
But in this case most of this code I wanted to be everywhere

140
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
And if we were to

141
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:56,767
Go down to the very bottom suppose

142
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
here

143
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
Is the

144
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,351
Get file

145
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
Path

146
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:07,519
So it is forming part of a whole bunch of code that I'm adding to the helper class of this component

147
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,359
And which I'm also using another components so

148
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:17,503
I don't need to redo this code anytime soon unless in in sorry

149
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,063
I don't need to come and open the

150
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
Component when I want to change this code

151
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,927
I can just change the code

152
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
Right there

153
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231
In the

154
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
Place that it's in the custom area

155
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:34,143
So that means if we close out here

156
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,447
And we go back to the custom code

157
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:43,359
You can see that the function is being used in component builder and in what field there PHP helper both

158
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
It's where it's added

159
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
And

160
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,295
If you'll need improving the code you can always at the bottom see in which areas is being used

161
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:56,927
So that is the option for multiple reuse of custom scripting

162
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:03,583
So you could put it anywhere you like in JCB either in the component helper class or in the component

163
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,607
View

164
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,423
You know PHP areas

165
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
And by doing so it gets reused it gets placed into that code on compilation

166
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
And that's really the answer I suppose

167
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,991
To the power of the customer code area

168
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:27,647
I realize it could be confusing because we are mixing it with the IDE custom code which 

169
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,415
These are

170
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
This hash

171
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,463
Automation

172
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
Is basically where you

173
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,839
Edited your code in the IDE like I did here

174
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,399
And the JCB is keeping track of it

175
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:43,519
And it's saying ok this is for the admin views template default body php file

176
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,359
And on the on this starting hash

177
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,127
Value

178
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,735
We are doing an insert of this code and you cannot maintain the code here

179
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
But it's only for one file one location one place

180
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,671
Then there's the JCB manual and the JCB manual

181
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:05,535
Is the implementation or the mutated implementation

182
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,863
Of using custom code snippets this snippet

183
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
All across in custom code areas

184
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
So that means

185
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:16,287
I'm using the same word custom code

186
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
For different implementation

187
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
And

188
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,407
That might have been a mistake because

189
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,991
You could miss it's possible differences

190
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
But there is most certainly a difference this doesn't target a file but a actual area

191
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:35,231
Somewhere in that JCB compilation

192
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
So

193
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
Yeah I hope that helps

194
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:40,095
Let me know.
