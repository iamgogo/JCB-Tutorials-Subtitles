Hi

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,352
We wanna look at MySQL tweaking

3
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,656
In the component area

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,496
It's open a component go to settings

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,800
And then there is MySQL tweak

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:18,176
What is this able to do is if you have multiple versions of a component

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
And

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:25,088
Partly you have demo that relates to a certain version of it and

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
Implementation of

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:29,184
Items

11
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:30,208
And

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,048
In another version you don't want those items that you know included

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
We have this MySQL tweak area

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,912
Where you can actually

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,728
First you've select that specific View

16
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:42,752
That you

17
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
Want to tweak

18
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,664
And do note that you can only make use of this feature

19
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
If you're actually using the

20
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,248
This

21
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
Area

22
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,576
Where we actually add Database

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
Connection between The View

24
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,184
Dummy data

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,976
And view itself

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,536
So let me quickly show you what I mean

27
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,936
So here I have opened field types which is one of component Builders own views

28
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,240
And I have it connected

29
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
To my Database

30
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,872
Through this MySQL I added yes I selected table

31
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
And then I selected

32
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
The field types

33
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,504
In my Database

34
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:27,296
And basically

35
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:31,136
Just let it all be taken into the build file

36
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
And

37
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
Now

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,304
Since you know that some of the versions that we distribute with component Builder

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,352
Doesn't have all the field types in it

40
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
And it's a limited

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
To only a certain few field types

42
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,544
So to show you how that was done I will go back to

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,824
That tweaking

44
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
Feature

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
So here I have component builder open

46
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
And if I go to settings

47
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,784
And I go to

48
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
this tweak feature

49
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
It's see that

50
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
I have

51
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Added

52
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,952
Values here

53
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,048
and certain of them like custom admin

54
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,328
I said no don't

55
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Include non no

56
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,752
Add MySQL to view Table if set in the view

57
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:23,104
So if the if the in the view if you have the MySQL selected

58
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:25,664
you can through this feature

59
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,736
Control which items actual IDs

60
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:31,040
Should be

61
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:33,344
Included like in the admin view

62
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,648
I'm only including these two ids

63
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,184
From my Database

64
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,024
And so it's the ids in the admin table admin view Table

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,096
And I'm also saying that it's ID based

66
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
You have the feature of

67
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,680
Just including all

68
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,008
And then you have id based

69
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
So it's a

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
A way to say what you want here

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,456
You can also if you are using ids between let say 1 and 50

72
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,296
Then you can use this arrow

73
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
Notation with an equals

74
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,672
Open open bracket there

75
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:13,280
to know take between 1 and like here 500

76
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
You want to add

77
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
And

78
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
You can actually

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
Do it quite simply with one two three and then

80
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:21,984
Comma

81
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,360
Ok here I'm explaining it nicely it says 1234 or

82
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,640
124

83
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,200
And then you can put a comma and then 20

84
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:36,832
And then another comma and then 40 to 90 so you can in the same comma

85
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,624
Delimited list

86
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,184
You can add this notation

87
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,768
To show that we need to include 1 to 4

88
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
And is immediately after it

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Add 20 and we will

90
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
Grab all that

91
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,472
Ids and

92
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,592
In fact it illuminate any other ids and only use the ones that you have

93
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Actually notated

94
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
So here is another

95
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Good example of

96
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:07,552
Using 1 4 2399

97
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
So goes on in here

98
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,928
We going from 597 to 604

99
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
682 - 68

100
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:16,768
4

101
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,583
And it's in the same comma delimited list

102
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:24,447
And we saying is it's id based and we say include these

103
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,775
So that is

104
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,151
That is partly what I'm having why why this is here what it can be used for

105
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:39,807
So you not including dummy data or example data in your component build structure

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
Then this area is really redundant and you don't need to even use it all

107
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,327
You can just ignore it system ignores it as if it doesn't exist

108
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
If there isn't any

109
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:53,887
Data selected

110
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
Well that is some tweaking feature

111
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,287
In component Builders component area

112
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,823
That helps you

113
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,615
Manage your

114
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
Dummy data between

115
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,455
Versions in

116
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
In your applications Thank you for watching.
