00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Hi

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:07,936
Recent question came up that was asking about help menu integration

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,984
For JCB components

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:13,056
You will see the JCB itself

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,592
Has this

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,408
Help document area

7
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:22,528
Now I have not actually had the time to

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Expand upon this help document area as much as I would like to and maybe in the future

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:29,696
We would

10
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:33,280
Still expand on it but it is a feature

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:39,168
That actually is very easily added to any other JCB component

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:41,984
If you have purchased

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,568
The Sermon distributor package

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,360
Let me show you what I mean

15
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
There is a place

16
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:56,576
One of the repositories on the VDM data I called JCB packages

17
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,464
So you go to VDM - io

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,024
And then JCB -Packages on GitHub

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864
And one of the package is here is Sermon distributor

20
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,400
You can

21
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Download this package

22
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
But

23
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,824
Before you haven't purchased a key for it you can't really use it

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,176
So to get a key you would basically click on this link here

25
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,248
Which is vdm.bz

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
/jcb

27
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,344
-packages

28
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
This will take you to a

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,000
Place on our website

30
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,048
Where you can purchase

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,864
The purchase the Sermon distributor package

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,424
Here is the

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
Link that you would need to get to

34
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
You can also go to VDM dot IO

35
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,872
Which is

36
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Our website

37
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:58,528
Some just open that and then under services

38
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
You can also find

39
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,088
Joomla

40
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,160
Sorry JCB packages

41
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:07,232
You just click on that it will take you to the same place

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
So there are a few packages already available

43
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,632
Which basically is a fully mapped component

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,424
Inside of JCB

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,824
So if you purchase this you would get information and a code and everything which will help

46
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,408
you install the Sermon Distributor package

47
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:26,944
So

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,016
I'm gonna quickly install the Sermon Distributor package

49
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,856
On this demo website that I am using

50
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:41,536
I'm not gonna demonstrate how I did that because if you purchase the package you would have all the instructions

51
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:47,936
And how to do this once you have installed the Sermon Distributor package you can go to the admin

52
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:48,704
views

53
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,568
And you will find that the admin views now has this

54
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,616
New admin view called

55
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:57,408
Help document

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,992
It's just As one admin view called help document

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
Now you by Default

58
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:08,672
With JCB have this demo component

59
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
So let's open the demo component and let's add the helper structure to it to demonstrate

60
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
To you how it works

61
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Now

62
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:25,312
At the moment it doesn't have any helper structure at all it is just a demo

63
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,384
Component with only a few

64
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Structures actually I think it only has that see admin view it has one view called look

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,648
And got no custom views but it got a site view called looks and looking

66
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:44,768
So what we'll do first is we gonna go to the admin views

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:48,096
I'm gonna click here to add another row

68
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
And we are gonna add the help documents

69
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
The support icon

70
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
Oh yes we can have this unticked problem I'm sorry about this while we are

71
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:07,808
Busy phasing out the repeatable fields so you'll end up working with Sub fields in the future sub forms

72
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:14,208
But to fix this in the meanwhile you just closed that and open it again and now you'll have all those

73
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:17,791
Tick boxes in place so I'm just gonna add that

74
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,607
view again

75
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,215
We gonna use the support icon and we gonna leave

76
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:31,615
Most of this to defaults except it doesn't have meta we don't

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,151
Don't use access

78
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:37,503
We can do the import but it doesn't have a front end editing

79
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,831
We don't want it to have one and

80
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
We would have it in the 2nd position

81
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,231
And maybe not part of the main menu

82
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,303
I think that's good enough now

83
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
We'll play

84
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
Save this

85
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:58,495
And we'll save and close that's really all it takes

86
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:04,895
So you've just install the Sermon distributor package into your JCB that

87
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:11,295
Added the helper document menu sorry the admin view and I've just linked

88
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:16,415
That view to the demo component then I'll go to the compiler

89
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,535
And I'm basically just gonna compile that demo component

90
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
And as you can see here it isn't here yet installed on my website this is quite important

91
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,543
Not to have it in installed on the website

92
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,127
Then I'm gonna compile it

93
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:39,199
Then I'm just gonna install it

94
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,391
Now if I go to demo

95
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,671
We will see

96
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,999
That it has this new helper documents area

97
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,095
Now at the moment it doesn't have any helper documents

98
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
What we can do to change that is we can then go to the helper documents click new

99
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,663
And when it's opened we'll select which group you want to Target

100
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
So I'm just gonna select all

101
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:18,367
Then I'm gonna select the I wanna target a view in the admin area

102
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:21,951
The demo will be basically the desk dashboard

103
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
Then there is help documents

104
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,607
This import I'm gonna take looks I'm on a target looks area

105
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
Then I can give it a title

106
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:38,847
And I can say what type of help do I want, I want a link to an Joomla article

107
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,407
Want to put in my own custom text

108
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
Or I want a link to an external URL This is usually what we will use when we ship a component

109
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:54,719
Since this will then give us the opportunity to link it to an external URL which

110
00:06:54,975 --> 00:07:01,119
We can update an edit without sending an update or you know and upgrade

111
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:07,519
To the component we can just change the help menu itself sorry the the help pages which

112
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
We linked them to and this is how JCB is been setup JCB is linking to an external

113
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:20,319
Help structure but you can decide whatever you wanna do with this component you could say text for

114
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,343
Example

115
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,623
And you could say

116
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
This

117
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
Is the help

118
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,999
You need

119
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,047
And whatever

120
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,583
And save and close

121
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,471
Now if we go to looks

122
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:43,871
We'll see that then automatically there is a new button here called help and if we click on it

123
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:47,199
It actually opens that help

124
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,039
And so you can now even going back to

125
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,415
If you now click on new then that help menu won't show anymore

126
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,231
But you can close out here

127
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:05,119
And you can then go back to the help documents

128
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
create another one

129
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
Again select or you could target a specific group

130
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,943
Or you can just target all groups

131
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:24,319
Again admin area you can also target the site area and be able to actually

132
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,135
Link it to any of the front end

133
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,511
Areas then we can say now we are wanna not

134
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:36,095
Target the list but the edit area which is singular

135
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
And again we can say

136
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,167
Give it a title

137
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,263
And again this time let me link it to an URL

138
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
And then

139
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Save and close

140
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,623
And then let's go to that area

141
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,951
And new

142
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,887
And now we'd see that area also has a help button if we click on it

143
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
It opens that URL

144
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,055
In a pop-up and as you see I just selected

145
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:17,823
A video

146
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
And so

147
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
That is how you can actually

148
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,223
Link

149
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,343
To other external sources to be giving the help

150
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,951
To the specific page in the instructions that is necessary

151
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,999
And you can then

152
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
Having set up a few help menus for the component you can go back to component Builder

153
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,703
And to the admin View

154
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,263
Area

155
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,799
And

156
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,407
Let's say you have a help document linked to component

157
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
Demo but it is

158
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:02,623
You want to ship it with the information that you've Now created as help

159
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:09,023
Inside of the component then what I would usually do is I would actually

160
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,327
Open this component

161
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,679
Sorry this admin View

162
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,919
And I'll give it a system name of demo

163
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,527
And I'll go to the MySQL

164
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,599
Say yes I wanted to link it I'll select

165
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,367
Table

166
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,207
And then I would go to the demo table

167
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:43,583
Help document you see demo help document click on that

168
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,167
And I'll just remove some of the

169
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,959
Values that I know

170
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,495
Is not necessary

171
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
Ok I think that's fine

172
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
Created modified can stay

173
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
I wouldn't even take the version out but

174
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,391
Doesn't even matter

175
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:10,207
We can most certainly take that one out

176
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,559
And there we go those seems to be fine

177
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
And save and close

178
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,911
Now

179
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,703
I can save this

180
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:25,055
Or save as copy

181
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:29,151
And if I have another component I'll just copy this one

182
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,223
And link it to that components data base

183
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
The only thing to remember when you've done this

184
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,719
Is it you must first compile the component before you uninstall the local component

185
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:48,607
So you would first come here and compile that component

186
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:01,151
Now let me quickly show you in the code what is happened

187
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Basically I've

188
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:10,111
Opened this zipped package of a component gone to admin area then to

189
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:10,879
sql

190
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,951
And then if I go to the install MySQL

191
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,255
Document

192
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,095
I'm just double clicked on that

193
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,727
And it's open this document I'll now see that they obviously has this

194
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,007
Insert table

195
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:29,311
But it also has

196
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,847
Insert

197
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
Data

198
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
That we created see there is

199
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
This is the help

200
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,551
You need there's a URL I added

201
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
And it will basically insert this data

202
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,487
Into the database

203
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,791
When this component is installed

204
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,583
So

205
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:58,239
Having done those changes and linking the table to the component

206
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
It actually goes to the database in the extract these values and places it

207
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,223
Into the dump file of the

208
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Component

209
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
It does not place it into the update file just that you know and that means that

210
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:21,023
If users already have your component installed and they install this

211
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:27,167
It will not add these helper structures you'll have to use

212
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:33,567
Custom scripting in the Joomla component area in the PHP tab there is

213
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:39,967
a place for update and uninstalled and installed

214
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
To add custom PHP script where why you can insert this data into the

215
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,159
Database

216
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:54,559
Ok now I'm gonna show you what happens if the component is no longer installed

217
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
And you try to compile it

218
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:01,727
The first thing is I'm gonna quickly uninstalled the demo component

219
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,359
Now I'm gonna go to the compiler

220
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
And I'm gonna try and compile this component

221
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
It will give me this error

222
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,463
And basically it's telling you that it couldn't find

223
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,743
This table

224
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,351
It couldn't find that table and it's because you uninstalled it

225
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
And the only way then to compile this component

226
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,007
Would be to go back to the admin view

227
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,847
And deLink the component from the table

228
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:42,687
So like I said make sure to compile the component

229
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
Before you uninstall

230
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,063
The component which you are linking to

231
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,599
So we linked

232
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
To the installed components table

233
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:55,487
The other way to try and avoid this

234
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,815
Is to actually instead of linking to the table

235
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,423
Like we did here is to instead use a dump file

236
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,983
So I would say you click on dump

237
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
You open your sql

238
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
File that it created

239
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
And you copy

240
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
The the values from that file

241
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
or cut whatever

242
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,135
And paste as values in here

243
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
Like that

244
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:32,351
You could leave the comment or even leave a comment out

245
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
And this way if we save and close

246
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
We will now

247
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:42,591
Even if the component is uninstalled be able to compile

248
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:44,895
And still have this demo

249
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:45,919
Or

250
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Shipping values

251
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,015
Of the component in place

252
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,087
So let's try compiling it again

253
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,095
This time it compiled without any errors

254
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,655
And if we go open the ZIP package

255
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:15,871
And then open this install MySQL

256
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,967
.utf8.sql file

257
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,575
We will see that it added that dump

258
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:30,975
Values right back into the file and that's exactly what you would like it to do

259
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Anyway

260
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,327
This was just to demonstrate actually

261
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
How to add

262
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,727
A help menu structure

263
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,775
To any JCB component

264
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:50,431
Basically you could do that without purchasing the Sermon distributor component

265
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
The only part that really is necessary

266
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,575
Is for you to create a helper document

267
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
And of course

268
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,159
This helper document

269
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:06,559
That we are using from the Sermon distributor package has custom scripting in it

270
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,423
And it's this custom scripting that makes it a adaptable to any other component

271
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
I can

272
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Quickly

273
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:18,335
Show you which areas this custom scripting must go

274
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:22,943
But obviously I would rather wanted to buy the components package

275
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,527
It's really only in a relation

276
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
To the articles

277
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,879
And to the site views

278
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,415
And the admin View

279
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,719
That we have custom

280
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,255
Fields

281
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
That are a little tricky

282
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,607
As well as the user group

283
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
You need to

284
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:45,727
Have a little perspective on how to setup user groups

285
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:51,359
So these are the two areas that are difficult the articles one as well

286
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
Because JCB when it has

287
00:17:54,175 --> 00:18:00,319
When it detects that this is a help helper document and it detects those specific field

288
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:04,927
Values that are set up correctly then it automatically

289
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:11,583
Build some of the front-end necessary concepts as well as adding

290
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:16,191
This dynamic behaviour in the backend

291
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:18,495
I hope this helps

292
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
to

293
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,663
To at least show you that it is very doable the adding and help

294
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,711
Structure to a component

295
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,527
What I think makes this quite unique

296
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:31,551
Is that

297
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,111
The component then ships with this

298
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:39,999
Pre built in help structure but the user that uses your component

299
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:46,399
He might want to give extra help or little different kind of help to the front end users of his

300
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Website

301
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
And he will be having access to this helper area and editing it and changing it to

302
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,175
To the correct wording and expectations that he might have

303
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Or she

304
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,967
Might have

305
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,855
And so that is the way that you could add helper structures

306
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
To your JCB components

307
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
Thank you for watching
