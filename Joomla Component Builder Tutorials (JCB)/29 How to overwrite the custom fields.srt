1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:04,864
It often happens that you would like to use some of the default fields

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,472
Differently than how component builder is actually implementing it

3
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:11,776
Now what is the default fields

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,824
If you go to

5
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Add a new admin view or if you go to an admin view that already exists like I've open one here

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,808
You'd see that there is this little note

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,112
Just above adding fields

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,904
It says that the ID

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,208
The asset ID the state

10
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:35,328
The access the ordering the created by the date created modified by

11
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,632
Date modified Checkout

12
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
Check out time version

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,728
Hits metakey

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
Meta description and metadata

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,176
Is already added to the view so these are your default

16
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:52,480
Fields

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,112
That always gets added to the view even if you don't create them in fact you don't need to create them

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
But I have seen that sometimes you might want to display some of these fields in a different

19
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:05,536
Area

20
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,072
Of the application

21
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
You see currently

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:17,824
The ID field and  the published

23
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,592
Where is it

24
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
I think that is State

25
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,432
Yeah

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:23,968
State field

27
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,320
Is the only field that is been shown by Default

28
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
In the listview

29
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,976
So here you can see there is the ID field and there is the states field

30
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
and the ordering field but the ordering field

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Obviously

32
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,680
Doesn't show the order number you basically click on that button there

33
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,472
And then you can move them

34
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:51,104
You know order them so all that is done by Default and so as you can see

35
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,640
The sorry

36
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,432
The other

37
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:57,248
Values are not displayed in the listview

38
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160
And so I had a client once saying to me that they would like to actually see the date that something was created

39
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,720
And also by whom it was created

40
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:12,608
And so I had to adapt component builder so that those things can also be overwritten

41
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:14,912
And this is exactly what we've done

42
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,496
What is done is if you create a field

43
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,616
In component builder as you would normally create a field and you give it

44
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:30,016
Any of these names you see created by or created date but obviously exactly

45
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
the same name then it actually will overwrite

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:42,304
The default so in this specific view the job order View

47
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,352
Excuse me

48
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
There is a field

49
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
Created by

50
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,496
So

51
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,032
I can open that

52
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,104
in a new tab there is also a field

53
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Created

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
That's basically the date let me just

55
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
See where it is

56
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
Oh there it is create a date

57
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,928
I'll also open that one

58
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
So in the

59
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
Field

60
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
You see that I basically used

61
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:18,144
The name created by

62
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,960
it's obviously a user is the type of field

63
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,080
And the label is created by the user that created this is the description

64
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
And that's all that's needed

65
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
For a user type

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,456
Then

67
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
In the created date

68
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:36,576
Basically it's a calendar type

69
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
And I used created

70
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,416
The date it was created

71
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:45,536
The label and some of its defaults now these values if you don't know them

72
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,352
You can actually go and look

73
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
At the compiled

74
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,216
Field

75
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,520
Let me show you that

76
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:00,128
So in the backend of your component that is administrator components

77
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
Then the relevant component

78
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,784
You would open models and then there is a place called forms

79
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,344
And you would basically open that

80
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,880
And you'd see a list

81
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,280
Of forms that correspond to the backend views that you've created so now in our case

82
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
This job order

83
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
Is the one

84
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
You're obviously open the XML

85
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,167
So you double click on it

86
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
And then scrolling down

87
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
You can look at modified by

88
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,335
And some of its default

89
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,383
So you gonna overwritten

90
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
I'm sorry overwrite this value

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:40,319
Then you need to update or basically use these values here

92
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:43,135
Make sure this is the only part that is

93
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,439
You shouldn't change it if you change it

94
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,719
We won't know

95
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
that you're trying to

96
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Overwrite

97
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,375
one of Default fields because it basically uses the name

98
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
As the identifier

99
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Ok so back here

100
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,287
We basically created the fields that was the first part

101
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
I'll just close them again

102
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
And then

103
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
We would like any normal any other field

104
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
We simply went to fields

105
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
And we added those

106
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,415
Fields

107
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:18,975
So here you would see

108
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:20,767
you scroll down

109
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,631
There's the created date and there is the created by

110
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:29,471
We add both to be shown and also the position

111
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,263
and how it should be treated

112
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
And we said it was be in the left tab

113
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,871
Of the 15th

114
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Oh yeah that's the other thing

115
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391
If you would like the fields to again display in the same place as before in the edit view

116
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:54,559
Then you would add it to the 15th tab I reckoned that its

117
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:58,143
Very unlikely that somebody would create so many tabs

118
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,935
Now what is a tab?

119
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:02,239
If you would to go to the view

120
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:07,615
Then this is tab 1 this tab 2 3 4

121
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
5 and 6

122
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
So

123
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:14,271
Since publishing can really vary

124
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
It wasn't

125
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,623
Making any sense to me that I would

126
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
Targeted in any way

127
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
Directly as the 5th of the 4th

128
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
So I took a very high number 15

129
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:30,399
It's not very obvious and this is why I had to make this tutorial

130
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
If you select the number 15

131
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
It will basically add these two fields in the same place it would if it had to build it for you

132
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
But if for some reason you say no I want to also display the field in a different tab

133
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:52,671
You could actually click and say let's say put in in the 3rd tab you click save

134
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
And and then you would compile

135
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
The components install it

136
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,071
And then

137
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,911
You see 1, 2,

138
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,959
3 it's in the third tab

139
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983
It's showing up

140
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,263
So

141
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
That's All You Had to Do as they had to say and what tab you would like it now to display if go here you would see

142
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,247
It no longer shows in the publish tab the create date

143
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,415
Its only created by that shows up here so it literally moves the field to a different tab

144
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,207
As well as

145
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
Now displays the field

146
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,327
In the listview

147
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,119
And that

148
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519
Simply because you added the value the fields here you said that you wanted to display and you added to the third tab

149
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
I'm gonna move it back to 15

150
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:48,223
Which is the tab number if you wanted to be in its default place

151
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,759
So I click save

152
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,831
and then save there

153
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
compile this install it

154
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:05,119
Basically updating the component

155
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,215
Refresh the page and now

156
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:14,591
If we go to where it was it's no longer showing there it's not showing there

157
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
It is not showing there it's back in published in the correct place that's where it

158
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
Will usually anyway be set if you don't overwrite it so using the 15th tab

159
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
As the the target

160
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:31,999
Puts it's in default place

161
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:38,399
And if you use another tab number it removes it from its default place and puts it where you have

162
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
assigned it to be placed well that is how you can overwrite the custom

163
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:48,383
Added fields Fields of a backend View

164
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,943
I hope that will be very helpful

165
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,223
Thank you for watching
