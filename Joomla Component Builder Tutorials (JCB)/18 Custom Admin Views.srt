1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,352
We need to have a quick look at custom admin views

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,936
They do have some nice ways of doing things

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:09,984
Very similar to sight views

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
But some

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:14,848
Aspects and adding it to component builder is different

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,504
And so in the next video We will look at adding site views  as well as component

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
Custom admin

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:23,552
Views

9
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,088
To the component

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:31,232
The reason I didn't speak much about the custom admin views is simply because

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,024
Summon distributor is not

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:33,792
Using

13
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,584
Custom admin views yet

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,704
Where is I have another component here I can use as a example

15
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:43,264
Called component

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,800
Is called

17
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:46,592


18
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,456
Cost-benefit projection

19
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:57,344
It's a It's a tool that is used to show companies the cost benefits

20
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:02,464
Of intervening on certain diseases and causes in the company

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:03,744
Anyway

22
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,816
In it we have what we call a company results

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
And combined results

24
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,168
Respectively used

25
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,984
To display custom data

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
In the back end of the component

27
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:19,616
 to the certain different

28
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,944
 people who has permission to view those data

29
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,504
Now in the component itself

30
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
If we clicked on companies

31
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:34,464
You would see there is an icon underneath each of these

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,536
Names of the Companies

33
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:41,888
And there is a new button here the top called combine

34
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,912
Results

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:43,936
Now

36
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
This button as well as those buttons

37
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
Are dynamically added by component Builder

38
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,408
And in the next tutorial I'll show you exactly how that is done

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,456
What I want to show you here is

40
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,296
Simply how a custom admin view will look

41
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:05,952
So I'm gonna click on one of these,  this is all dumb information so

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,792
So you'll see me

43
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,096
Let's open this one

44
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:22,592
Now basically you have this big area where you could put a lot of HTML and PHP

45
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:26,688
And you have some custom buttons that you can add on show you that

46
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,736
And then

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,856
So all of this in this white area is simply done in the custom View

48
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
So if I was to click around

49
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,464
I've got a menu here at the side

50
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:42,304
All of this is done inside of the custom

51
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
Area

52
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,144
Of the component

53
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,704
Which is now the

54
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
Custom admin View

55
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
And

56
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
That is basically how it will look

57
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
It has Different

58
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,200
Value sets

59
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,784
And you can from here add an edit button

60
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,624
Since we've linked it to a specific client

61
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:10,208
Or company or one item in that list

62
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,256
We can actually click on edit

63
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:15,584
From here we go right into the company's data

64
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,632
And edit it

65
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:18,912
And

66
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,472
What is nice if we were to click close here

67
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,032
You actually take us back to that

68
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Exact result page

69
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,712
And you can then go and look at

70
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,992
The implementation

71
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,272
What you've done

72
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,648
Is it that is just simply showing you how a custom admin view could look

73
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:44,256
Let's go back to the company's list or we could go back to dashboard

74
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,816
now look at component Builder

75
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:52,960
And we looked at this company results we open that one

76
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,800
And here is all PHP and HTML

77
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:57,824
On my page

78
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Doing all the work

79
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,896
And of course

80
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
As you might expect

81
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,736
I'm loading in a lot of templates here

82
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
So I'm loading in templates

83
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Directly

84
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:09,856
From here

85
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
And

86
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,464
Then I have a custom button area

87
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,303
Where I can I can say yes I want to add custom buttons

88
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Then I click on

89
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:22,655
Custom buttons here and you see I have

90
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:24,447
Icons I can select

91
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Call it

92
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
The name of the button

93
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,567
And a controller method

94
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:35,967
Which I would like to use to actually make the button work so in this one I'm saying go to company

95
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
This one is edit company

96
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
And

97
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,599
here I should say

98
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
Is this gonna

99
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,719
What kind of Target are we think looking at

100
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,255
Is this a

101
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
A single a list or both

102
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:54,143
And you said that respectively

103
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:55,167
And

104
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,519
Then you click save this only saves it to the form not to the database

105
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
We should have made that done

106
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,895
But this is the Joomla's way of implementing it

107
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:08,735
And now you have to add

108
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,783
In the PHP controller method

109
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:12,319
Add scripting

110
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,647
to respectively implement the buttons click

111
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Method

112
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
You can also to the model

113
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
So in the controller

114
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,839
You can add script and then in the model

115
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:29,215
Add scripting which is called from the controller if you want to separate your code a bit

116
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,287
In the in the and if you're not gonna be adding

117
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,103
Any script to the model Just add none

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
with this two

119
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,711
Spaces in front otherwise it might scream at you that you

120
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,039
did not add Script there

121
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:47,647
And as you can see the go to companies is simply

122
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
Take me back to the company's View

123
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,743
Where as the

124
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,303
Edit company

125
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,655
Implements the Joomla's convention of opening an item to edit it

126
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
By the correct channels so this is just

127
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
Joomla knowledge At work here

128
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:07,103
And we are checking a token and all that

129
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
So do Component

130
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,455
Builders sets of all the tokens and everything

131
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
So you

132
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,319
The snippet you can reuse for your purposes if you want

133
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,207
And obviously we have an area for custom scripting and as you can expect

134
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
There's a lot of custom scripting

135
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Going on

136
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
In in that View

137
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,543
And it has its respective places again if you wanna know where what's happening at some snippet here

138
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,383
Compiler components search for that snippet and you'll see where this comes up

139
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:43,711
If you're not certain by the naming conventions we have used

140
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,295
And that is really how you setup a

141
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
 admin custom admin View

142
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,671
To look at the other one

143
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:54,207
Let's close out here

144
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,535
That is the combined results View

145
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:04,447
Now the combined results is this one up here if you click it now I will tell you this in we need to have some item selected

146
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,263
And then you select the items and click

147
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
There again

148
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
And it will do a combined resolve

149
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,407
Taking both companies

150
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
And

151
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,223
Adding it's data together

152
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,783
And giving you a nice layout structure

153
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,831
Of it's data sets

154
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,623
Ok

155
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,671
That is really the combined concept

156
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
If we go back

157
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,255
To the implementation of it

158
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
It looks very similar as the other

159
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
Again just a lot of HTML PHP here

160
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,959
And then

161
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,055
Also some custom button is again just going back to companies

162
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:45,919
And it's really just same implementation V card companies go back single

163
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
And then some custom scripting

164
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,319
And that's how I set up both of those custom views

165
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
quite simply

166
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,671
Adding that the data here

167
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:02,047
And then making use of the templates as well as layout implementation in both of these

168
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:05,119
So you can set up layouts and templates and

169
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,167
Only use them and site views

170
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
But you can also use them in admin views

171
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,007
Now

172
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,543
In our next tutorial

173
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:16,895
We look at how to add site views and admin views to your component

174
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
Since there are some differences

175
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,503
And you need to be aware of them
