00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,792
Hi

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,584
Today we would like to look

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,352
At

4
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,888
Component builders

5
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:06,912
Options

6
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,728
Or what we would call Global settings

7
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,544
Now I possibly through the

8
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
Tutorials have

9
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,152
From time to time touched on certain areas

10
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,712
Now we would like to give a more

11
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Precise look at

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,040
The options area of

13
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
Component Builder

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,136
It's accessible through the options button

15
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
And if you have the

16
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,720
Permissions you'll see this button

17
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,768
and I can open it

18
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,048
The Permissions

19
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:38,656
By that I mean certain users may not see this button if they are in it

20
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,960
Different group than that Global

21
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
administrator

22
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,776
And

23
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,104
You can change those permissional structures is as needed

24
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
So you click on options

25
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,712
And this will open

26
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:57,856
The component builder configurations or global settings as it's often referred to

27
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
or options or settings

28
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,304
And there are number of switches here that is worth knowing about

29
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:11,168
These areas here you could add your own details if you would like to

30
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,704
have it displayed

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:15,520
In the components front-end

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,640
Then there is a switch here at check-in timer

33
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,016
We build into component builder the option to check in the items

34
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:27,296
Every so often

35
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,344
And here you can check

36
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,744
If an item have been locked out for 5 hours it brings it back in 12 hours

37
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
24 hours

38
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,096
Every second day once a week or never

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,912
So the check-in timer is set here

40
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:47,264
And you can change it to whatever is best suited to your system

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,080
And then enabling version

42
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,128
Version control

43
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
Is what this area is all about

44
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,272
You can disable it by simply saying no

45
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:02,112
Or enable it by yes

46
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
And then you can say how many

47
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
Versions should be kept of the item

48
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:12,352
If 0 all all versions will be saved so 0 means

49
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,376
Everything

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,960
And so you can Limit it

51
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,520
To sort of prevent your system from

52
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,592
of being overloaded with data in the database

53
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,664
Then

54
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
You have minify JS

55
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Feature

56
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,320
Basically all the JS that is being built

57
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,624
In a component Builder

58
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
Can be

59
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
Changed to be minified

60
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:39,744
So

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
Why you are in production

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,096
You can export your components

63
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,400
Without minifying the j s

64
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,008
In the files and in the footers of the of the documents

65
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
But the moment you feel that you've reached

66
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,432
The place where minification is necessary and you want to use it

67
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
Then you'd simply trip the switch here

68
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
And that would minify JS which is your

69
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:05,856
JavaScript

70
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
In the component

71
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:08,672
While it's being complied

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Ok

73
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,304
And then just some details my wife

74
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,840
Being very involved in

75
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:18,144
Discussing

76
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,192
She is a Java Developer

77
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,728
And

78
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,312
Helping me look at some of the implementations

79
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128
As well as my own details

80
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,480
And like I said you can add more contributors here and they will show up

81
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,296
in the dashboard underneath contributors

82
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Then the 

83
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
UiKit

84
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
 settings

85
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,096
This is primarily for the backend at the moment being implemented in certain areas

86
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:52,704
But this is only really needed most of the time and the front-end framework

87
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:54,240
Of your component

88
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:58,336
So I've added it to component builder simply so that

89
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,104
There

90
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
If I

91
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
At some point decide to start adding

92
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:06,784
a front end shop for the components that's being developed

93
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,184
That's part of what we possibly would design eventually is a front end Distributing

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,720
Software

95
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,815
That was built by component Builder

96
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,119
So you could install this and

97
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
Then run it from your

98
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:26,495
It's Like factory with a front end basically

99
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:29,311
That is still in planning

100
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,455
We still looking at some of the security risks since so far we've been encouraging people to use the

101
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,527
Component builder offline and not online

102
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:43,903
So we not even sure how this will work possibly we might end up with two

103
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:50,303
Components ok then the encryption settings component builder has a few places where it encrypts

104
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:53,375
Some of the data in the database

105
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:59,775
And we are using a basic encryption which means we are using this key that you enter here

106
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
Once you've entered this key

107
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
I think because it shifts without a key in it

108
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
So look like that

109
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
So once you've entered the key

110
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,319
Please ensure that you don't change it

111
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
Because

112
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
This key is what

113
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,719
Locks the data and it's the only key that can unlock it

114
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:25,375
So if you remove this key you cannot unlock it so you could remove it if you wanted to

115
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:28,703
Prevent people from knowing the data in those fields

116
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:34,079
But then you need to save it somewhere else because if you don't have it

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
Then you can't retrieve the data

118
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
And decrypt it

119
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:39,199
Ok

120
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,015
The next up his folder paths

121
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
.

122
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,183
There are two folder paths that you already can make use of the backup folder and the get folder path

123
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
Please read related

124
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:53,791
Notation here

125
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:58,655
Where is the custom folder path in the compiler folder path

126
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,751
I would suggest at this stage that you don't make any changes to them

127
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:09,663
I added these fields because I envisioned the possibility that we want to move these folders

128
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,943
Out of our

129
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,967
Web

130
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
Area of developing

131
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
Since these are part of the security

132
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,855
Concerns we have

133
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:22,207
That these files and his folders might be targeted

134
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:27,583
But I haven't fully implemented this all cross the compiler infrastructure

135
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:31,679
So currently it's best to leave that

136
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,055
folders the way they are by not adding any data in here

137
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:42,175
Sorry I clicked on the back button there anyway

138
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
Said by just leaving this fields blank

139
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:46,527
We ensure that

140
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
The

141
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:52,159
Next type we can look at the permissions

142
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
Now the permisional structure in component Builder

143
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,303
Is not that intense

144
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,143
But as you can see there are a lot of permission switches

145
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:06,239
With the latest Joomla release of Joomla 3.5

146
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:12,127
This permissional structure updating construct is made much easier

147
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,407
In the past

148
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:14,943
We had a problem

149
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,015
Were the data set of your permissions is so big

150
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:24,671
That when you save it it just freezes up your browser and even the server doesn't wanna receive the data set it's to big

151
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,535
Now they have added Ajax per field

152
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,351
Which makes this so much easier

153
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,399
That means that currently

154
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
Without clicking save and close You can make changes to the permissional structure and that

155
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:43,103
Immediately will be stored to the data base

156
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
That's from version 3.5 Joomla

157
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Now

158
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,087
How would that be a see we still have these areas that we also want to store

159
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
So

160
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
What I have thought might work

161
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:01,023
Possibly my implementation isn't that accurate

162
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
But

163
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:08,447
You have here configurations only as a permission so I would say take a

164
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,727
Certain group

165
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
Give them that configuration only

166
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
Access

167
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,895
And then

168
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
Log out

169
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,295
Of this user login to a user that is in that group

170
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:26,111
Then this permissional or tab won't show

171
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,927
they will only see the settings

172
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,743
And which are in these tabs right

173
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:36,351
And so they can make changes to these and save them without any

174
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
Browser latency or

175
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,191
Overload

176
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
Where is you can come in and you can just tweak the permissions when you are in the global or super administrate

177
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,199
So you can come in here and you can tweak the permissions accordingly

178
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,247
So as you saw previously

179
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:57,087
What I was here the manager area I could just changed

180
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,207
Change this and it does a Ajax storing of the value in the database

181
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
Which is really smart I am very grateful that they've done that

182
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:11,679
Search for the main reason that this this set of the

183
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,703
Remissions

184
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
Became so huge

185
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:21,407
That I had in some places had to do server adjustments on some of my components

186
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:27,039
To to ensure that the user could still save and change the permissions

187
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Now

188
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,367
So you have your

189
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,487
You're a global create delete edit edit State edit own

190
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,327
Edit created by and edit created date

191
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,375
And then you get

192
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,655
The per

193
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:43,423
View

194
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
permission structure

195
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,311
So here is the admin view then the custom admin view the dynamic get

196
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
And they all have their own

197
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:56,479
Different areas that you can change permissions

198
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,295
Four groups to be able to do this or that

199
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
The same permission implementation

200
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
Options and

201
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Structures

202
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,559
Are available to all components built by component Builder

203
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,143
As you trip the switches for the fields as well as

204
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,935
For your

205
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:16,703
Certain

206
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
Views

207
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,567
Let me just go out of this to show you

208
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,615
Components

209
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:26,431
Then first be look at

210
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:28,479
components

211
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,063
Sermon distributor

212
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
here

213
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:40,511
In the admin views

214
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,839
You have here

215
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,383
This access control

216
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,967
But this is not the only place of implementation

217
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:06,623
save and close

218
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,511
If you go to the admin views

219
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,095
And let's say we open

220
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Preacher

221
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,943
You have the permissional structure here

222
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,015
Edit

223
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,367
Now if select view is gonna use the view name if you select core

224
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
you will fall back on the core edit

225
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
And

226
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:42,975
Delete

227
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,767
Features corresponding

228
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,327
So if you use the word View

229
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
View dot edit

230
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:51,167
you will see in the permissional structure and edit

231
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:54,495
Switch with this views name preacher dot edit

232
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,799
Where as you use the word

233
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
Core dot edit that you would only see

234
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Edit or delete or create whatever

235
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,199
Select

236
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,319
And this in relation to its record means that it will be added

237
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,415
To the record itself you can tweak the edit structure

238
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:17,023
This is only the global setting or this is for both

239
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,911
And so that is party how you control some of the permissional switches we just looked at

240
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
The other area is in fields itself

241
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:29,823
You have your a permissional structure

242
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:33,663
Where you can say ok this specific field let say the preacher name

243
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:39,039
I wanna control that permission who can edit it

244
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,599
Is what you would add

245
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
who Edit button

246
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,463
Currently we are not yet implementing who can View

247
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
Since we were having problems with

248
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:50,815
Tremendous overload of

249
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:53,631
Switches being added to the permissional structure

250
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:57,983
Joomla now made this change we might possibly add that in

251
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,031
Then you can't even have a

252
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,079
View who can view that

253
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,359
That field

254
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:06,431
Where is this is currently just who can edit it

255
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
Ok

256
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,367
So this is how you get a Fields permissional switch

257
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,135
Now

258
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,951
Let me give you this is an example

259
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,999
Let's make that one for now

260
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Name

261
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:24,607
Say that it must be permission

262
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,143
Save and close

263
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
Save and close

264
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,311
Here I have sermon distributer open so I will open it's options

265
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Go to his permissional tab

266
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,175
Then scroll down

267
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,735
And I see first here is the help documents

268
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
And here's preacher

269
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:47,135
And preacher has side access and an access to preacher itself

270
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,183
And batch create

271
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
Dashboard add dashboard list delete edit

272
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
edit created by edit created date

273
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,167
Edit own edit State edit version

274
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,007
Export import submenu and then it starts with series

275
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
So as you can see it doesn't show name here yet

276
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:11,199
So what we'll do is now will go back to component builder go to compiler

277
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:17,087
And we will select sermon distributor

278
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
And compile it

279
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:25,023
Wanted completed I'll just click on the install button here

280
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,815
To do a quick install

281
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,447
Now that that is completed let's go back to the configuration and just refresh

282
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:35,519
The page I'll just click on the refresh here at the top

283
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:39,871
Now if we scroll down again it we'll get here we said

284
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:46,015
See it got a new field here called preacher edit name and how I can decide

285
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:51,647
Can this group edit that name or is it denied or should it be inherited

286
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:55,743
So the permission or structure per field can be added in this way

287
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:58,047
I'm gonna go back and revert that

288
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,095
Because I actually don't want

289
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
I don't want that area to be monitored

290
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
So go back

291
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,311
Open preacher

292
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Back to the

293
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,871
Fields

294
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:13,151
Say no

295
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,295
Close compiler

296
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,647
Select sermon distributer compiling it

297
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,719
Then installing it

298
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,047
Going back refresh

299
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,959
And we see that the field is gone

300
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,799
So it's no longer being controlled by this permission

301
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,079
Infrastructure

302
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,919
And so that is how you can

303
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Tell which

304
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,783
Group is able to access which fields

305
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,831
And even a which

306
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,879
Views are accessible

307
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,951
Through the permissional of structures

308
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:04,351
This is an amazing advantage of component builder in its ability to integrate the

309
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,143
Permissions not only per view

310
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
But also

311
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,447
Per

312
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:10,495
Field in a view

313
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:16,895
And your normal control also related to a specific view and not only that it

314
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,223
Also adds these permissions to every item

315
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:24,063
So you could override an item

316
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:29,183
And say ok this item I don't want that group to actually access this field

317
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,303
And this is one of the advantages that component Builder

318
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,119
Has above other

319
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
Similar applications out there

320
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
It's it's ability to implement some of the most advanced concepts that are currently accessed

321
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,991
Ok so that's a quick look at the

322
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,551
Global configuration options

323
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,087
for component Builder

324
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Thank you for watching
