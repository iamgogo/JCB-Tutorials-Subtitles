1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,096
In the previous tutorial we where looking at setting up

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:04,864
Of

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
Templates and

4
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:09,472
Layout to a site View

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,616
Now inside of the side view we see that we are loading preacher panel

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Preachersmall

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,176
Preacherbox

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,200
So

9
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,784
Let's go look at how to create those templates

10
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,832
I'll go to templates

11
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,696
And here they are already created

12
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,024
You can click on new to start with a new template

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,072
You could also copy an old one

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,608
By selecting

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
The template

16
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,216
you would like to copy click on batch

17
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:43,776
And then there is a copy feature here

18
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,568
And click process

19
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,616
And it'll copy it for you

20
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,664
Ok so

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,688
here I have

22
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:52,480
Preacher panel open

23
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:59,136
In Preacher panel it's the same concept it's an HTML area so if I wanna use PHP I need to go

24
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,184
Into the PHP

25
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,976
And then I can go out again

26
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:07,072
And I can also add this text placeholders

27
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
Which helps us to ensure

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
The text itself

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,936
Is translatable

30
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,288
You can just do your normal English text like that sermon count

31
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,080
Sermon total downloads

32
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,872
And

33
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,968
Component Builder will add these strings to the language file for you

34
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
And

35
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:29,344
You don't need to be concerned though at this stage only does

36
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368
Your

37
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,440
British English language file

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
And

39
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,536
If you need to add more languages

40
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,168
You need to look up the documentation of adding languages to a third-party extension

41
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,704
And

42
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,008
do that same implementation

43
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,128
Ok so here we see that you can add layouts

44
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,456
To this template by using any of the Snippets

45
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,272
to this template 

46
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320


47
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,648
And you can add other templates to it

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:06,464
So you can use templates inside of templates

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:12,608
And you could have use layouts as well so more or less the same behaviour as in site view

50
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,680
You also have your snippet box here

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
Which you can make use of adding

52
00:02:18,496 --> 00:02:19,776
Script quickly

53
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
To your page

54
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
Like that

55
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
Refresh

56
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,248
We see that that script that I just looked at here

57
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
In the preacher panel

58
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:36,672
If we go to the code preacher panel

59
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:42,816
it Is exactly the same script that you seeing here

60
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,632
Ok now

61
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,472
There are a few

62
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:52,288
exciting points here

63
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:57,152
One of them is a side note is that in your details tab

64
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
In the template area

65
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,224
You're at the bottom

66
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,016
You can add

67
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,040
JavaScript

68
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,344
With your normal script tags

69
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,232
So you can just add your JavaScript in there

70
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,768
And

71
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,536
It will work

72
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,584
And be loaded into the page

73
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,120
Through the small snippet

74
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,680
That's That's a nice

75
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,216
Thing to know

76
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
As well as

77
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
You are still have access as I said before

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,664
to all the global

79
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,456
This field values

80
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
Like you can see there

81
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
You can access those

82
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
quite easily 

83
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,744
And that is basically how to set up a template

84
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,840
Is the same kind of conventions as setting up a site View

85
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:52,192
Except that this is not the main view it is a template used

86
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
Somewhere in a main view through

87
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,568
Adding this code snippet

88
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:00,640
With Joomla class get

89
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
template

90
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
Method

91
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,456
And

92
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,480
Then

93
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Basically this

94
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,416
Load template

95
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,696
Is the method

96
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
That is being used with that name

97
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
And then it adds it

98
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:22,399
Do your component site view as well as

99
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,935
Adds the code to it and everything else

100
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
So that is a template next up let's look at a layout

101
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,615
And it really get excited there
