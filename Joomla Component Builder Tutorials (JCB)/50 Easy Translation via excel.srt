1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,864
I"d like to give you a

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,984
Quick overview of the new implementation that we've added

3
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,288
To JCB

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:17,152
That allows you to do translation

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
via a

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
Excel spreadsheet

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,320
It is really just to

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
Make it easy for you to

9
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Build your component

10
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,232
Extract your language strings

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,768
And give it to someone else

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,352
Have them do the translation in whichever language you like

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,912
Have them give the spreadsheet back to you

14
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,728
And imported into JCB without

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,848
The necessity of struggling with INI files any of that

16
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:50,944
So that was what we wanted to achieve

17
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,992
The other thing that you need to know

18
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,784
Is that JCB

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:57,600
Doesn't really work with placeholders

20
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,160
When it comes to these translation strings

21
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,512
It actually works directly with the English

22
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:06,048
String

23
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,584
And the reason we did that

24
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:10,656
Is because the place holders

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,472
Which in the INI file is the

26
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:14,496
Let me just show you

27
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,520
Quickly

28
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,312
If you look at these

29
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,104
For example may be back

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,688
This

31
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Word

32
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
This English word here

33
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:31,648
Might be ended up being used in multiple views the same English word

34
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
But with a different

35
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
you know a placeholder

36
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,536
So

37
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:40,864
What we did instead as we said to Ourselves ok

38
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:47,264
To ensure that you always translate this specific English string only once

39
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:53,664
We will only add the string and wherever it is reoccurs will replace it

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
The string itself

41
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:59,040
This should be an advantage

42
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
I can understand that

43
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,648
That you might want to have a differently

44
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,208
But this is how we've gone about doing this

45
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,024
And so when you think about create new

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,096
Create new comes you know is used

47
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Many places over in

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
In the you know in the files

49
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,728
sorry

50
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,032
In relation to these placeholders

51
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,152
But you only need to translate it this create new ones

52
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,944
And we will add it

53
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,992
The compiler will add it

54
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:30,016
Correctly

55
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
In every other place where it belongs

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,112
So that's really

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
The first thing you need to keep in mind

58
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,208
The second thing which is

59
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Almost as important

60
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,608
Is that you often have strings that are across multiple components

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,448
So the string back for example again or cancel

62
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,728
or close

63
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,080
It is not only used in one component is used in many components

64
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,200
And so we also said to Ourselves we want to still just translate close

65
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:00,224
Once

66
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,808
And then in every other component where it's used

67
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,368
It will automatically be used

68
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:13,024
And so when we go to JCB if you have a fresh install of JCB

69
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,608
And you scroll down and your open language translations

70
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
You see that there is no values there

71
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:24,544
A same as if you opened languages there's also no values there

72
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,872
If you want to have JCB

73
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
Populate the translation the English strings

74
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,808
So where does it get them well it gets them from your fields

75
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:37,856
And from your site views

76
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,136
And from

77
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Any other place either

78
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
Your admin view or

79
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
you know

80
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,304
Any other place where you use

81
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,376
Translation strings

82
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:55,776
In then it populates dynamically the language translation so you don't really ever need to click

83
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
New

84
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
To create any it creates it

85
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:03,968
For you so the way to do that if you would go to the compiler

86
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,040
You select the component that you would like to compile

87
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
And you simply click compile and you need that do that only once now you can just clear that out again

88
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,232
You don't need to use it

89
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
Now if we go back to language translations

90
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,839
Suddenly

91
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:25,471
There's a whole bunch of strings here and also tells you that it hasn't been translated and all

92
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
So just that's quickly and we got

93
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,823
Almost 

94
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
249 strings here

95
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:37,247
And like I said close will only be shown up once

96
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
So

97
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
It is with every other strain

98
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:45,439
If we then open one of these

99
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:51,583
You see that you cannot edit the English string now we've had request

100
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
The people would like to edit the string but it doesn't really make sense because if the string is

101
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Is being used

102
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,031
In a

103
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,055
Field

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,615
How would we be able to know

105
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:06,431
That their relationship here needs to change

106
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,991
For example if you update a string here

107
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,039
Now JCB needs to know

108
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,367
In that field in needs to update the label for example

109
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
There's no way for us to it

110
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:17,951
you know to determine that

111
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:22,047
So you'd basically change the string and it won't be useful

112
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,863
Because it JCB on compilation

113
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,447
Will deter will detect that this string doesn't exist

114
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
And it will just create it again

115
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,847
So the way that you would change a string which is found here

116
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:39,455
Is you need to go and change it in this either

117
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,039
The field where it was created

118
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
Or the site view or the admin View

119
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,695
And I mean in this case we know that this word demo

120
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:55,327
Is the components name right so if you wanna translate that string

121
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:58,655
Oh sorry change that string

122
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,983
So for example I'll quickly demonstrate that

123
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:06,847
I'm gonna change this demo to two o

124
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Like that

125
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,455
And then save and close

126
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:17,087
Now I'll compile it again

127
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,839
And just cleared out and then go back to our language translation

128
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
And now

129
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,215
You see the demo is gone because

130
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,775
Demo is no longer being used anywhere

131
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:39,871
Another component either so the system will automatically remove it

132
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,711
If you go to the end of the string will see the new ones

133
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Have been added

134
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
See there

135
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
So that's how you would

136
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,671
Change a English string is you'd go back to where you set it

137
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,999
And then from there have it been changed

138
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,351
I'm gonna just changed it back quickly

139
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
And then compile it again

140
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,823
Clear it out again

141
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,127
Go back to language translations

142
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,735
And you see that it's removed the other one and it's added to correct one back

143
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,271
Now

144
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,391
I'm gonna translate or I would like to translate only this one string

145
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
And if I wanna do that

146
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,255
You see that there's no language is available

147
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,375
We decided to allow the languages to be set dynamically meaning

148
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
That you would manually create them

149
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
And use them as you like

150
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,775
So there is an area called languages

151
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
You'd click new here

152
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:47,455
And then you'd give the language name and it's tag now the tag

153
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,759
We've given you an example here

154
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:52,831
But if you do not know how this should look

155
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,927
There are ways for you to find out one of the easiest ways

156
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:01,279
Is there actually just go to Joomlas translation area

157
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,327
So if you go to community

158
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,167
.Joomla.Org/translations.HTML

159
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,215
And then you select

160
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,775
I would say just selective

161
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
This one that's the newest

162
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,639
And then you'll see there's a whole bunch of languages here

163
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:19,199
Clicking on any of these

164
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
Will take you down to that language

165
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,063
And basically this is

166
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,879
The little tag that you would look be looking for

167
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,255
So if you want to do for example Dutch

168
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
Then this is the the one

169
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,423
The the tag that you would use

170
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:41,215
You would use the

171
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:43,775
Dutch as the name

172
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
And then that as the tag

173
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,175
I'm gonna set up just for example I'm gonna setup Afrikaans

174
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,223
Is my native language

175
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
So

176
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,295
I'm just gonna use Afrikaans

177
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,391
As the language we wanna create

178
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,951
And obviously then this is the

179
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:03,743
The tag

180
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,167
And you can create any of the languages you want to use

181
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,263
We might at some point at a few major languages here

182
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,823
And ship it like that but

183
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
Just that you know you could just create a language

184
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:25,247
You Cannot create a translation for that language unless you've done this

185
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,295
You must first create the language

186
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,343
It is just the way it works

187
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:34,207
Now we can go back and

188
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,071
Let's take a string that

189
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
Would look different in Afrikaans

190
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
So let's take author

191
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,127
So now here if there's more components which the word author is used in

192
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:57,247
It'll all be linked in here and it all be done automatically you wouldn't need to do any of that

193
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,903
You will only really need to focus on this translation area so author in Afrikaans is

194
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,463
skrywer

195
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
or outeur

196
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,911
So will use the outeur which is actually more correct

197
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
And then

198
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:19,775
Will you select the language for which that string belongs

199
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,079
And then save and close

200
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
And that is as simple as that

201
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
From now on in any component

202
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,247
Where the word author is used

203
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
If

204
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,855
The Afrikaans translation with relation to the other strings

205
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Is enough

206
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
It'll dynamically add this language

207
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,511
To the component

208
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,327
And you would not need to translate it again

209
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
Now this is all been the way it's been working up till now so this is none of this is new

210
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,799
The area that is new

211
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,871
Is that you can actually export

212
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,407
these strings

213
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
To a spreadsheet

214
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
And then

215
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,527
You can import them

216
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,415
From the spreadsheet and it will dynamically be added so

217
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:15,071
I'm gonna just select a few strings here you don't need to select any of the already translated

218
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,095
strings

219
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:21,215
But if you do it will also be used if it doesn't really matter

220
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,287
I'm just gonna select a few

221
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,055
And

222
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
Click export data

223
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,407
This will create a

224
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Excel

225
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:32,223
Spreadsheet

226
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
Which you can then save

227
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:40,159
I have now open that spreadsheet and you see that it has a bunch IDs

228
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
And then it has English

229
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,023
It's got the

230
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
The tag of the language

231
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,399
And it's got the value that we already set

232
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,959
So now I'm gonna set

233
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:56,543
The value for these others in the spreadsheet

234
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,335
So now you got your

235
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
Language

236
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,431
File back from your translators

237
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:05,247
And they basically translated it

238
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,783
This column

239
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:11,647
Now you can have multiple language every every language will have its own column

240
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,183
And

241
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
All you need to ensure that this top header

242
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
Is the language tag

243
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,143
That's really what's important and that this language

244
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,471
Is created and published in your system

245
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:28,543
Do not let them change to English string

246
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,103
When you import this file

247
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,943
The system will look for the ID and the string

248
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,271
To identify that this value exists

249
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
If it doesn't exist it will simply ignore it

250
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,903
So if you change author

251
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,719
Even though the ID Remains the Same

252
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:51,327
It will not find it and it will simply ignore this line

253
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,935
On the way I'll demonstrate this is I'm just gonna change back to having to k's

254
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,239
And

255
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
Save this document

256
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:03,615
And then let's go back and import it

257
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:08,479
Now the imported is simple we just click on import data

258
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,063
Then we select the file from our system

259
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:16,159
Click upload file

260
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:21,535
And it should dynamically mapped the columns in your spreadsheet

261
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,071
To the

262
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,375
Table columns so you would have

263
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,935
Your language strings if you got multiple language

264
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
It should automatically mapped in

265
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:35,359
If you are having multiple languages and you only one import for the one language

266
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:41,759
Then all you need do is add this ignore the column next to the language as you do not want to 

267
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:42,527
import

268
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:45,855
Ok and then you click continue

269
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,439
And that is it you will now see

270
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:53,791
That it has added translations

271
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:55,583
Except for back

272
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Now

273
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:03,519
At first it didn't actually add these so I had to quickly go and add a little fixed to the

274
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
import

275
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,335
I didn't realize that

276
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
At the moment

277
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,943
It actually would stop at the first failure

278
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,735
And not import further

279
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:14,783
But I've just fix that and should

280
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:17,343
Within the next update this should be resolved

281
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Anyway

282
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
the point is

283
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,231
Once you've imported it you'll see that it is added

284
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,535
The translations to

285
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,815
Those

286
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Strings

287
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,423
And it's also mapped it to the correct language

288
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:39,359
But back was not imported because the English string didn't actually correspond

289
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
If we go back to our spreadsheet

290
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:45,503
And fix this little error

291
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,599
And in fact make a little tweak to

292
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:52,159
What are the other strings

293
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
Just for example sake

294
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:59,327
And then go back to importing this file after Saving it of course

295
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,351
Save

296
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,727
So again import data

297
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,775
Browse

298
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:16,735
Now you'll see that back is been done

299
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:22,879
And the other one that we also played with was disclosing new

300
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,207
We added to the double T there

301
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:30,047
So now you are able to export

302
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
This language strings

303
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
Translate them in a spreadsheet

304
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,191
And easily import that spreadsheet

305
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
Which word automatically update

306
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Your values here if you

307
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:46,687
Have updated more than 50% of the English strings

308
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,735
To a specific language

309
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,551
It will automatically be added to your component

310
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,391
You can change this percentage

311
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,183
By going to options

312
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,487
In JCB

313
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,815
And then basically changing this

314
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:08,191
Select the percentage any language should be translated before the system

315
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:11,519
Should add the language to component during compilation

316
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
So that means

317
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:18,175
If more than 50% of your English strings have been translated

318
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
It starts adding it to the component

319
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,271
If not

320
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
It will just ignore it

321
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,135
Ok that is

322
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:32,511
Giving you a quick demostration of the new import export

323
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,815
Option in translating

324
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,863
The strings in your system

325
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:41,215
And knowing that if you have translated any of these strings will only

326
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,007
You need to do it once

327
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,407
And it will dynamically be available to every other component that uses that field or that View

328
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:53,247
And therefore these English strings

329
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:56,063
Thanks for watching
