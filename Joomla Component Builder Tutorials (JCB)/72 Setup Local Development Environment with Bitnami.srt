1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:06,912
I wanna give you a quick tutorial on how to use bitnami on your local development environment

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,240
Bitnami is a very well known

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,056
Distributor of images

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,360
They actually have

5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,664
Association with Amazon

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:19,456
They really know

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,480
What they doing

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
And for local developing environments

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,112
I found them to be the most convenient

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,696
But then again that is if you are not afraid of command line

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
Would you shouldn't be

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
Command line is an amazing world for you to make use of as a developer

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
And

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,728
It'll be good for you to just you know

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
jump in.

16
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:48,384
Ok so the first thing I did it's just Google Bitnami

17
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,688
Joomla together

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,760
And you'll see there is actually

19
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
A

20
00:00:55,296 --> 00:01:00,672
Download Joomla Bitnami and Bitnami Joomla installer

21
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:07,072
And how to install Bitnami Joomla and here's even on Joomla even a documentation 

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
installing Joomla using Bitnami

23
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:09,888
Joomla

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Now

25
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
We can we can open this

26
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
And

27
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,776
we'll see

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,080
That it has a

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:23,968
Recommended stack for Windows Linux and Mac and it basically deploys all this

30
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,016
You get a little

31
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
Setup Bitnami Joomla setup tutorial which takes you through the process of installation

32
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
Helps you select

33
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
 the place

34
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,584
And adds information and then

35
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,888
That's basically it you done

36
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,984
So it's sort of does what

37
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Other

38
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,432
Similar components do but I have experience because it's targeting Joomla

39
00:01:54,688 --> 00:02:00,832
It really does and places everything so you could you could just click on this link here or

40
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,928
You can if you check there at the bottom it says Bitnami.org stack Joomla

41
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
And that's basically the same

42
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
as the first one here

43
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:13,376
So you could also just clicked on this result and

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:19,776
I'm gonna well maybe I should just download it and run it but because

45
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:25,664
I'm on a Linux environment you would basically take click on this one here

46
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
And then

47
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,504
You select the environment which you're in

48
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
And you would just click and

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Download

50
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:39,232
No thanks I don't want to register

51
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:41,536
Just wanna download it

52
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
And that's really it

53
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,864
Just click and download

54
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
So I'm just waiting for the download to start here

55
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,056
And then just save the file to your local system

56
00:02:54,592 --> 00:03:00,736
And then basically run the file now if if you if I just click back a few

57
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,528
If you used Microsoft

58
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,112
They have executable

59
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,696
see it's exe file so you just double click on it

60
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:11,744
And and that should get you going

61
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,816
And the same goes for Mac

62
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
So you you just double click on the file and it will run you through tutorial

63
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:27,616
I'm using Linux which is a little bit a little bit different because it using run

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,456
File and you need to start it from command line

65
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
As you can see

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,928
I just downloaded it is already got Joomla 3.8.11 it's it's always up-to-date

67
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,072
So if you're on a Linux system you would say open in terminal

68
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,216
Do me a quick ls la and I will see the file is not executable

69
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:56,032
So we'll make it executable

70
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
So they will be sudo chomd 

71
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,664
plus x

72
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,712
And then the file name enter

73
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,320
I'll ask you for your password of course and you typed that in

74
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
Wrong wrong command

75
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,143
the typo it should be chmod

76
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,983
Ok now the file is executable

77
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,311
Check it out it's sl

78
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,079
correct

79
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:37,247
Once you've done that you can close to the command line so basically it was just to run

80
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,295
this chmod command over here

81
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:44,415
To make the file executable

82
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,975
Which is a safety

83
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:50,815
and making sure that it runs

84
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Correctly

85
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Now

86
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
You could just double click on the file

87
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,727
in your file system

88
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
And it should start there Bitnami

89
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,591
Tutorial

90
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,087
So I select language

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:17,951
And welcome to Bitnami Joomla Stack

92
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,535
And yes we want all of this installed

93
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
And we just gonna select

94
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Well let's just say

95
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
Like that and called it

96
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
and next

97
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
And then you can give some

98
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:43,295
Yeah some defaults here

99
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:47,135
And I'm just going to give her a simple password

100
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,439
And next

101
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,791
And it's asking for the MySQL port

102
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,631
The I know that I've already got MySQL installed here

103
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,703
 let's see

104
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:06,591
which is 3 0 6 so 3 0 7 should be OK

105
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
just gonna give it a name

106
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,479
I'm not gonna do email here

107
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
And I'm not gonna

108
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
Try and link up with Bitnami's 

109
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Cloud

110
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
And then

111
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
we're done

112
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:21,695
Next

113
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,511
It's basically going to run the installer

114
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
And deploy

115
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,887
Everything you need the PHP the MySQL

116
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Joomla with its Database

117
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,751
It's really setting everything up for you

118
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:41,407
And if you gonna be doing local development I suggest using this path because it takes care

119
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,943
Everything for you

120
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,759
And does it in a way that doesn't affect

121
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,575
You're already existing PHP

122
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
And you're ready existing

123
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,695
SQL and everything else

124
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,279
it really packages it into a folder

125
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,303
Which 

126
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:00,351
I've just like using

127
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
we're almost there

128
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,759
 doing now the MySQL Database

129
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,343
creating the databases

130
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,999
This can take long depending on your systems resources

131
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,351
now to removing the

132
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,911
Things that it doesn't need

133
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,287
Well actually it's setting up and uninstaller Script so if you didn't like

134
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
This you could

135
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Then undo it

136
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
Are we done

137
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:53,087
Now you can launch the Bitnami Joomla Stack and just click finish

138
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
And there we go

139
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:57,951
we got it installed now to access the Joomla sign

140
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
It basically using my

141
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,351
Local IP right and then we go Joomla

142
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
and there is our Joomla website

143
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,311
And obviously to access the admin

144
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,335
Admin

145
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:23,807
There we go now to login here they have default passwords and stuff set

146
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,695
Basically the one that you typed in during the installation

147
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:32,511
And there we go we are

148
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,375
Here and we want to get JCB

149
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
So we install the

150
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,959
The web tab

151
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:45,055
and we type here JCB enter

152
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,431
And it comes up we click on it

153
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
And we say install

154
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:56,319
It usually will grab the master branch which

155
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,415
Is usually in sync with the latest release

156
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
And we install

157
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:09,631
It's also not counting these downloads so that's one of the reasons we don't have any idea

158
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:12,703
How many are using JCB at the moment

159
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,799
Ok once it's installed

160
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:20,383
You can actually go and open JCB

161
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
We are now on a little

162
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,527
Screen issue here I just downsize a bit

163
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
But here we go

164
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,135
let's grab 

165
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:36,511
A demo package by going to install JCB packages

166
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,839
And here is VDM packages

167
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
And there's the community packages

168
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:45,215
And we can

169
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,495
Grab

170
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,823
Any of these let's just take the Hello World

171
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:56,735
And get the package so as you can see I've done nothing I've just deployed

172
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:03,135
Bitnami, I haven't touched any other feature of PHP or anything else

173
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,951
it just grabs the package

174
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:11,071
And it validates the checks sum for us we force it to update

175
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,119
And we click continue

176
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
And now it's importing the hello world component

177
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
And there we go it's done

178
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
Just to show

179
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,383
we quickly go here and we compile Hello World

180
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
And install

181
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,807
And here we go Hello World is there

182
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,343
And it is working

183
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,391
We can add a greeting

184
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
And

185
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,999
It's It's doing everything is expected

186
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,303
We also can check the front end

187
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,375
Main menu

188
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
Change the main menu by

189
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:51,007
Using the Hello World greetings

190
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
And save and close

191
00:10:55,871 --> 00:11:00,479
Just before we do that we go back to Hello World we opened the options

192
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,807
check out the permissions we search for

193
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:04,831
Site

194
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
We see there is

195
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:13,535
two and they're already set to allowed greetings if not you just change them to allowed for the public

196
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
And that is the the two areas you would like

197
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,935
And then you can click here

198
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
And there is some text you see it

199
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
We have not

200
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:30,431
Given the public actually the edit rights so it will say that it's not available

201
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:34,783
But it can actually check some text and go back to home

202
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:41,183
So we see that the Hello World tutorial is functioning on our Bitnami

203
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,207
Within

204
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:44,255
How long did this take

205
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,047
11 minutes

206
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
Anyway

207
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:54,239
Thanks for watching that just a quick demonstration of setting up a local developing environment with Bitnami

208
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
And the reason why I take this path

209
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,871
Is primarily because of what I'll show you next

210
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:06,015
Here you have the bitnami folder remember we've typed it in

211
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
And there's your Apache

212
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
There is all the files

213
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
And

214
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:14,207
You want to go into the apps folder

215
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,023
Then into the Joomla folder 

216
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:23,423
And into the htDocs folder in here is your whole Joomla website and you can you can open

217
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:26,495
And go in and actually

218
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Work on your components

219
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
And edit it's files so this this is really the biggest reason I want to be able to

220
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,759
Easily access the files and work with them

221
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:41,599
And so it is it's very doable here

222
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:46,207
The other feature which just comes out of the box by Default

223
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,535
Is actually if you go back enough

224
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
You'll see

225
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,399
It is that it has

226
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,519
In the apps folder, you can see that has the PHP my admin installed

227
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,823
So that means

228
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615
You could type here

229
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,711
PHP my admin

230
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,879
And be right there able to access PHP my admin and check out of databases

231
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:21,279
This all Bitnami did out of the box without real complications anyway that's the

232
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,679
Reason I like using bitnami on my local developing environment and they are quite quick

233
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:32,799
With the updates you can actually if we go back to that folder

234
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
You'll see that it has your and uninstall and a manage

235
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,711
Files

236
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
So you could run this one to uninstall and you can run this one to manage the environment

237
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,743
Which does actually check whether the server is up the configurations and

238
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
Civil events and stuff like that

239
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:56,351
You can stop all

240
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:02,239
And then the other one which I like is that you can click here

241
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Uninstall

242
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,199
Do you want to uninstall Bitnami Joomla stack and all it's models. yes

243
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:19,647
And it starts to uninstall everything removes everything so you could run

244
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
This do some work save your components export your JCB packages and then completely

245
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:28,607
This thing and

246
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,631
Move on

247
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,519
But it's dangerous do keep in mind it really removes everything

248
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,615
Ok well that's this is now the end
