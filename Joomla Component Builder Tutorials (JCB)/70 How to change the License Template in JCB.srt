1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:04,864
I would like to talk to you about changing the licence template

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
For your component

3
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,520
This would be expected that you've made at least

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,080
40% change

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
To any of the demo components

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
Yes so

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,296
Let's say you've changed this component

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,344
Quite considerably

9
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,648
Then there is this place called

10
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,952
Licensing template

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,304
Now it actually tells you there what you should do

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,584
Select a file

13
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,656
That should be used for license all files

14
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,448
Found in

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,496
Administrator component

16
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:43,520
Component Builder

17
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,544
Compiler

18
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
Now the files

19
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,432
What I should add to the note is actually the txt files

20
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:54,528
So that means you could put any txt file in there

21
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:57,344
And then selected here as a license template

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,136
Now let me show you how that works

23
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,952
Ok first of all

24
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
It must be done

25
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:09,888
When the Joomla component Builder's ready installed on your website.  So here I have a website Joomla Mount

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,680
So in Administrators

27
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
Component

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,264
or administrator 

29
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
components

30
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
component builder

31
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,896
There is a folder called compiler

32
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
And in it there is

33
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,968
123

34
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
4 txt files 5 txt files

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:29,600
And going back to the component

36
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
There is

37
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:37,280
12345 files I see it's also using the HTML

38
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:39,840
That one will obviously not come out right

39
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Ok

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
So

41
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:46,240
These ones with the .txt's the one that you would

42
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
Select

43
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
Any one of those

44
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
To be the template that you are going to use

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:58,784
Now if you use one of the existing templates and just change it then with the next update

46
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
Your changes will be overwritten

47
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,392
So you wanna do it in a way that sort of

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
Preserved your changes

49
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:09,792
And the way you do that is you actually go

50
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
Back to that area

51
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
And then you select

52
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:15,936
Or let's say were you selected default one

53
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,520
And maybe you don't like this

54
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
So you want to take that out

55
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
like that

56
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,896
And maybe you don't want to really support

57
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:27,968
Or show that you used JCB so

58
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
Take that out

59
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,064
I really don't mind

60
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,832
in fact

61
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:36,416
I'm so much so supportive open-source that

62
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
I don't

63
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
I don't mind you changing

64
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
Anything here

65
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,608
And anything else in fact anything there

66
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
And anything there

67
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
This I would want you to leave

68
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,752
Basically

69
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,312
Because you could set this in the

70
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
you know these placeholders are being replaced

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
By the settings of your component

72
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,992
So that means you could still tweak this

73
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
But do it in the component

74
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
But leave a license somehow

75
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:06,112
Copyright notice

76
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
So that people know how to use your program

77
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
But

78
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,048
Having said all that

79
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,448
You do realize that the lot of the code between all the components at JCB built are more or less the same

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,752
It's just little names here and there

81
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,824
and that's really the only thing you copy writing

82
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,616
Just keep that in mind

83
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
You're not copy writing the

84
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,504
Every little line really your copy writing the changes because

85
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,040
The

86
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:41,440
The idea of how built is already been copyrighted either by Joomla itself or by

87
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
sorry

88
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,864
JCB yes that's right so just keep that in the back of your head

89
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
Your copy writing the changes you've made

90
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
And that would you done

91
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
And maybe when someone uses your component they won't think about it that way and I don't I don't mind and I nothing

92
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,456
Anyone would because we are open source community

93
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
But

94
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,832
If you do change your program to a proprietary software

95
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
You might have

96
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,416
to

97
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:17,024
Yeah you know you need to look at What would be the implication because

98
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
I think

99
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,887
There's a possibility that some areas

100
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,935
Cannot be made proprietary be

101
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:28,031
Because of the Open Source license already being on JCB

102
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:29,055
And on

103
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,079
Everything that it's

104
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:30,847
done

105
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
Ok so that's just I'm not sure I'm not a lawyer I don't know how all that works out

106
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
But

107
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:45,951
I want to give many people so much freedom and I'm not really gonna check people up

108
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,791
Someone else may there is actually places that

109
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,351
Might feel obligated to do so

110
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,423
I wanna be busy with code

111
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,959
Writing programs

112
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Ok

113
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
So this is how you change the template

114
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:07,967
More or less you could leave things in the one that think that's the most let's see

115
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,759
You can check between them

116
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:15,903
You see like this the way to know what is all the place holders that are available

117
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
Is really to go to the

118
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
Let's see helper

119
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Compiler

120
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,167
I think it's that infusion is 1

121
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
So

122
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,007
You should look at the infusion

123
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,287
Now like

124
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,871
There is a company name you see there's a creation date

125
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:41,759
There's the built date there's author, author e-mail website copyright license version

126
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Actual version

127
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:48,159
Component names for short description description

128
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:51,487
Image type access so they are

129
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
Really

130
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,815
Most of these aesthetic

131
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
A content placeholders could be used obviously some of them won't make sense like custom helper

132
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,751
Script that

133
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:08,383
Means it's got add the custom helper script in that lines It's not gonna come out right

134
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,455
So these Place holders are really from where

135
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
The content is being updated in the file

136
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
Ok so you'll see

137
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,111
That it is the same

138
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,255
This is a new method we are using to put it in the hashes these these hashes here

139
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
So

140
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,607
Basically the creation date

141
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,911
Is this one here

142
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,263
And it's getting it from the infusion which is found in helpers compiler

143
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:39,103
So you can check out these and use any of those as you like

144
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:41,407
The point being

145
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:43,199
It's best to leave this in

146
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,855
And at least tell people who who who you do did it so someone

147
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:53,439
Can be blamed anyway

148
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,719
And

149
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
There we go now

150
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,815
If you just save now

151
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,399
It'll still work the default template will be updated

152
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:09,055
But the problem is the sooner we released a new update for JCB and you install that update

153
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
Is actually gonna over right this

154
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
So what we would suggest the saying save as

155
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,479
And then give it

156
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,551
your name I'm just gonna say

157
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,391
q

158
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
Default q

159
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Save

160
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Now we have a new file

161
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:31,839
And we can actually go back to JCB

162
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
And we can just refresh the component area

163
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,007
And now we'll see that there it is

164
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,031
The new

165
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:40,799
Template

166
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
Now if I save

167
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,431
And compile this component

168
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
It will actually

169
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,855
Use the new template now let me first see do I have it installed yes I do let me show you that

170
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:59,743
So in the code we go down to sermon distributor we just open any of its files

171
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
And that's how it's current template looks like

172
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
Ok so there is the current template

173
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:07,167
All the way down to there

174
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
Now let's compile and see

175
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,079
It'll update every file across the

176
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
Spectrum

177
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,175
So we just gonna say

178
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,735
sermon distributor and compile

179
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,367
Ok and then this install it

180
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:30,463
Now let's go check out our template

181
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,583
And now if we scroll up we see up it's got the new

182
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:36,863
The new

183
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,191
Template is being used no longer the old one

184
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,775
It's the same file I just it just refreshed it

185
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,799
In the background

186
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,079
Ok so

187
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:47,359
That how it works

188
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Easy

189
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:54,783
To change the license and that's really means you can make it a small or is big as you like

190
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Any shape and size

191
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:02,207
Just keep in mind that you need to escape it and unescape it

192
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
Because otherwise it will mess up the code

193
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:09,887
Ok well that is how you change the license template

194
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
Now

195
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
So

196
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:16,287
Make a wise decisions and how you deal with this area

197
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,615
I don't wanna say too much more and put

198
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,431
You know restraints up because really

199
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,527
I know that

200
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,367
The initial Desire here

201
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,951
Was really to give everybody as much freedom as they need

202
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,743
Thank you for watching.
