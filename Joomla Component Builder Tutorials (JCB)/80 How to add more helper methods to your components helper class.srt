1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:05,632
Ok let's quickly look at adding and methods to your components helper class

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:08,192
you obviously go to the component

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,472
And

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,520
Then you go to this

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
Libs and helpers tab

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:19,200
There is a few areas here to Target the helper class

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
And

8
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:23,296
There's one that's called site helper

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,624
Then there's one that is called

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:29,952
Admin

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,488
So you could

12
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,512
Add this

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,304
This is the admin area

14
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,888
This is the site area then there is one called both

15
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:44,032
So if you want to add and helper method to your

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
Site area

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,920
You basically added here like I've done with this

18
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,944
Fancy date

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,272
Added it to the site area of the component

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,832
Just to demonstrate the other one

21
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,880
The admin area I'm just gonna

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:00:59,648
Say

23
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:00,928
This

24
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,720
Is admin

25
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:07,840
And then I'm also gonna do the one that says both admin and site

26
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,888
And just say

27
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,704
This is both

28
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,752
So basically

29
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:20,128
If you want to add a method that it must be accessible from both front and

30
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
Backend site and admin area

31
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,736
Then you use that one

32
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:29,600
If you want a method just available in the admin area then you use this one

33
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:34,720
And if you want a method available in the site area than you use this one

34
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,304
And so 

35
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,632
Let's let's run this and see how it looks

36
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:44,960
Ok I'm gonna compile it

37
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:49,312
Ok let's see

38
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:55,968
Let me just quickly go and remove that I don't want that in there

39
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Ok I'm gonna just install this

40
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Then go let's go look at the code

41
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
Ok so we have

42
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,440
I have our Joomla Mount

43
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
Project here

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
and there is the admin area

45
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,560
And there is the front end

46
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
components area

47
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,168
So let's first go to the admin area components

48
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:20,288
Then to demo and then we go to the

49
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,568
Helper area

50
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,224
And then we go to demo again we open that up and if we scroll down it says here this

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,624
This is admin this is both see so it added those values in here

52
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:37,952
And we don't see the date

53
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,744
Function here

54
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,304
Because it was set to for the site area

55
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
So if we

56
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:46,656
Close the admin go to the component

57
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,960
Then again demo

58
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Helper

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
Again demo

60
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
We'll see

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,360
That it has this

62
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
Fancy date

63
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Set here

64
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,968
And then it has this as both

65
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
So

66
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:07,392
Whatever is placed in both gets placed in both the front and back or site and admin

67
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,672
Helper class

68
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
And then you could target specific areas by either just admin or just site

69
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:20,704
And that's really how you get methods into the helper class quite easily

70
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,520
Now if you want to

71
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,128
Actually add your own file your own helper class

72
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,480
Then you'll have to do a lot more to get this to work

73
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,040
Because the helper method

74
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:38,112
Is being called in the components

75
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,160
Main file

76
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
so you see there is a register

77
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
The helper

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
Method

79
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
See it's getting registered here

80
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,168
And so this is the helper classes name

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
And whatever

82
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,496
Method you wanna call

83
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
So if you wanna call for example we are in the site

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:58,592
Area

85
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
Say we wanna call the fancy date

86
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,712
We'll basically

87
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
Have to call it like this

88
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,064
Which I suppose this

89
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,600
Easy to understand

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
So that's how we would call it with the

91
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
date value

92
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Ok so

93
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,191
That's how you call it and then you obviously put it into

94
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,007
Whatever other variable

95
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
you want

96
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:31,103
And you use it as you like

97
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
If you add your own helper class

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Meaning your own file literally

99
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:43,391
Then you'll have to go about this a little different

100
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,255
There is a way to do that let me quickly show you

101
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,887
It's a little bit of a workaround because I've had to do that

102
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
Sometimes

103
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,055
First of all you obviously use the

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:03,359
File and folder inclusion

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
I did the advance one or the basic

106
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:08,479
Depending on where your file's located

107
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,807
And then you would grab that specific

108
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,831
File

109
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
Let's say this one

110
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:16,927
And you will placed the path

111
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,231
In corresponding to the

112
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,351
Zip file where you wanted and whether it should be updated and all that

113
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:30,751
Same goes with this I'm not gonna explain how you add the file that much because there is tutorial how to do

114
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:33,055
this and just go watch it on

115
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
on YouTube

116
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
If you have questions

117
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
But this would be the first step

118
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,503
Second step is to obviously add that

119
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,783
Specific file

120
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Now

121
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
We have in the component helper

122
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:49,951
We have what is called a global event

123
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
So the global event

124
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,143
Is an event you want to trigger as often as the helper class gets added

125
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,703
So it's a little bit of a

126
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
Little in-house tweak

127
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
Because we want to sometimes have a

128
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:11,199
Event take place every time the helper class gets loaded

129
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,759
So this is the admin

130
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Event

131
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
Add a global admin event so every time the global

132
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:21,439
Admin is going to be added

133
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:26,815
We want a method to be triggered so

134
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,351
What is that method

135
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,959
First wait to see all that is I'm just gonna add here

136
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:34,495
The event

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:40,895
So if you can see so I'll just add that little snippet there that's just for the admin area and gonna save and

138
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
close

139
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
And then compile it again and install to see it

140
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
in the code

141
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,343
Ok let's go to the code

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
Say yes

143
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
Now we'll see

144
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
This is the site the helper method

145
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,047
Let's go to the admin helper method

146
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:02,399
We'll see now there is a global event

147
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
That says

148
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,959
The event

149
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
In the

150
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,007
Admin

151
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,311
This is the admin if we look at that path

152
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
It is the administrator component

153
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,223
Com demo helpers helper class so this is the admin event

154
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,807
And it now has the string of the event in it

155
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623
If we go to the admin area

156
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,903
And we open

157
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
The demo

158
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:31,839
Main file which is what Joomla grabs he's start with this one

159
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:35,423
We'll see that there is a little bit of a snippet been added

160
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
And that snippet

161
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Triggers

162
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,263
The global event

163
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,543
With

164
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,335
The document

165
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,151
Object being passed

166
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,783
So going back here here comes the document we can actually affect the document

167
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
With a global event

168
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
Every time

169
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
A view of this component loads because the helper method

170
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Always Gets

171
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,791
Triggered every time this backend admin

172
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,071
File gets loaded

173
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,095
So

174
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:08,959
You have a event now if you want to add your custom

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
Helper class to be available

176
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
The way to do that

177
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Would be just to

178
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383
Add it here

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
To this event

180
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:22,527
Because then you can add your own helper class so we'll call this

181
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
own

182
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:28,159
Just just an idea and Let's call this file also

183
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,183
Own

184
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Ok

185
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
So

186
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
And then save that

187
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:42,495
And from now on every time in the backend

188
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,055
This helper method will be available

189
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,335
To you to use

190
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Without ever

191
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,991
Sorry helper class will be available to use with whatever

192
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,783
A method is in it

193
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,135
So going back to the UI

194
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,999
You obviously have to load this file in manually like I've showed when

195
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
We started looking at this

196
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
But now going back

197
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
We'll just

198
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,935
I like this thing

199
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Copy

200
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,007
Go to

201
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
The component

202
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
And

203
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
Then

204
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,431
To the event

205
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
And basically add that in there

206
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
And update our little comment saying

207
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,367
The

208
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:32,415
Custom

209
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
Helper class

210
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,423
Now what's important is you could do the same

211
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,703
For the front end

212
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,823
That is the site event you can add the same here you'll just again

213
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:53,407
Have to move that file to the front ends helper

214
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,455
Folder

215
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
With the helper

216
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:03,391
Sorry the file including method there is tutorials on how to do the file including

217
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,791
You know and moving it to the helper class and all that there is tutorials and how to do that

218
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:14,655
I'm not gonna demonstrate again please just go look at the tutorials on YouTube

219
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,775
There is tutorials about this I'm sure you can find that's not that hard

220
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Ok save again

221
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Should have been save

222
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
and close

223
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
So just to demonstrate

224
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,247
I'm gonna compile and installed this demo component once again

225
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Now let's look at the code

226
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
And we'll see now

227
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,647
It's being triggered

228
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:36,927
Here

229
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:38,719
As well as in the site

230
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
Component is being triggered

231
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
And here it is being triggered

232
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
In the main document and also here in the main document site and admin both alike

233
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,871
So that's just too quick work around which isn't that much of a workaround it's

234
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,687
Just basically using a global event

235
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
To handle file inclusion

236
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:06,879
If you wanted to only be done per a specific View

237
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,695
Then once again there is a different way to do that

238
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,743
And there is away actually to do that

239
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,303
But

240
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,423
This is how to do it globally for all the views and have that helper file already there

241
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:25,055
I usually just use the components own helper file mostly

242
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:29,151
I really hardly ever use this event for

243
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,943
Inclusion of files

244
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Simply because

245
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
Why

246
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,551
Put it another place just put it here

247
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:42,207
But there is other purposes you see me passing the document object there

248
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,351
And that could be because I wanna add some things to the document before any paid loads

249
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
And that's what I I have it there it's quite useful for that kind of use anyway hope 

250
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:58,079
This helps thanks for watching until next time take care
