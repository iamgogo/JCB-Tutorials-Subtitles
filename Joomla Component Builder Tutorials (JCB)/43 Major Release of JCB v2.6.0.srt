00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,560
Hi

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:05,376
I would like to demonstrate to you

3
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:09,472
How to upgrade to version 2.6 of JCB

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,312
The upgrade is quite a major upgrade

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:18,688
Because we are removing all repeatable fields in the Joomla component area

6
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,248
Joomla component area

7
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:22,784
Has quite a lot of

8
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
repeatable fields

9
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
If you were to open

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
A component

11
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,928
You'll see that

12
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:30,208
Repeatable fields

13
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
are basically

14
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,328
Little models that pop-up

15
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
With values

16
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,472
And as been used quite excessively in this view

17
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,104
The reason why we did that is because it's really a very smart field

18
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:51,712
Because it combines these values into one value

19
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,784
Basically the JavaScript on the page

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:58,624
Grabs these values and converts it into one value

21
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
Which on submission

22
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,720
The form

23
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,024
Only submits one string

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
And not actually

25
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,096
Several fields

26
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
So to me it's

27
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
Feels like we going a few steps back

28
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
But I suppose there are some conventional

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,592
Reasons which

30
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,360
Makes

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
The repeatable field

32
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,200
On a subform level

33
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,224
More

34
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
desirable because of its

35
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,368
Ability to actually validate the data more

36
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,392
Correctly

37
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,696
None the less

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,072
We have to remove these Fields because in Joomla 4 they no longer are supported

39
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,400
In doing so

40
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,216
I had to decouple a number of these fields

41
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Into their own tables

42
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
Because of the size that we would

43
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896
Of values that will have on the page

44
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,200
The page becomes immensely heavy

45
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,784
And so they're about 9 new tables

46
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,600
Being added to JCB

47
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,880
To accommodate this

48
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
So the real

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:10,048
Change Is Gonna effect only the components area

50
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:14,400
But because JCB is very Dynamic component

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,032
That actually integrates with various levels of this data structures

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
I had to also upgrade the compiler

53
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:26,432
As well as the import and export of JCB packages

54
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
We have tested this and it's for the most part those involved into testing

55
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
Have found

56
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,648
That

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,952
This transition is actually

58
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
Major improvement to JCB

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,072
And should be very

60
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,144
easy and you shouldn't have any issues

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,216
Those of you that might run into

62
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:50,240
Little

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,568
Glitches that doesn't work as you expect

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,200
We would suggest that you clean your browsers cache as well as memory

65
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
We found it

66
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,576
Traces of the old repeatable field structure and

67
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,624
JavaScript surrounding that

68
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:10,720
Might clash with the new changes in JavaScript

69
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:12,768
Within the new update

70
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:19,680
So to clear your browser memory not just the cache is quite important only after you've

71
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,704
On the upgrade

72
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,776
And you started working in different views

73
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
You should see that

74
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:26,592
Everything

75
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,128
Works as expected

76
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:29,408
Now

77
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:33,504
An area which even at this stage has been

78
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,600
Been reported in giving some conflicts

79
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,648
Is the dynamic get area

80
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,952
The dynamic get area

81
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Basically returns values

82
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,792
From

83
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
The admin area

84
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,912
Where if we target let's say backend View

85
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,192
And we grab

86
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:52,960
You know

87
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,008
Some information

88
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:58,080
These values are returned from the admin area

89
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:01,152
Where it basically goes to this Admin View

90
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,688
And

91
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,224
Builds this structure

92
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:08,064
Now as you can see with my demonstration here

93
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,112
Everything is really working

94
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,904
As expected

95
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
If if you at this stage

96
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,791
Would test this area before the upgrade

97
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:22,399
You should find that it works

98
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Without any problems

99
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
If it doesn't

100
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:31,871
I would suggest clearing your browser memory and trying again

101
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,943
Until you can find that this is working

102
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,503
As you see mine working here

103
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,039
And

104
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,879
The reality is the only thing I've done is I've cleared my browser memory

105
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,975
So that there's no all traces of JavaScript

106
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:53,119
And what I say clear I mean literally going here to to history and just wiping everything

107
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,679
For this domain if you don't wanna clear

108
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:01,055
You know all of your history and it specifically targeting this domain

109
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
That you are loading your

110
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
JCB component in

111
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:10,527
Ok so that is just few heads up for

112
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
The current

113
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
2.5.8

114
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,903
The upgrade should be quite simple

115
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
The release I've just released it like 8 minutes ago

116
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:26,143
So you should just be able to go to you know updates in your managing area

117
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,215
See that the upgrade is there and ready

118
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,007
Click

119
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,311
on it and click update

120
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
There we go

121
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
The upgrade is been done

122
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,039
If we now go back to

123
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
Joomla component Builder

124
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
We should see

125
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
That

126
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
It's up-to-date

127
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,487
And everything is

128
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:54,047
Been done without any errors

129
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
If we now go to the

130
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,399
Joomla components area

131
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
You should see

132
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,983
A view similar to this

133
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
With a lot of new shortcuts

134
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
To these different decoupled

135
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
Areas that I mentioned

136
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,967
And if you open the component

137
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:17,855
Not much has changed in regards to where what is located

138
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:23,487
But how to interact with it is actually been moved so for example the component updates

139
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,303
If you see it as what as a button here if

140
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
you click its gonna

141
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:30,143
Ask you first save everything before you continue

142
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
If you've done so

143
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,311
Then click ok and it opens the area where you then would do your updates

144
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,127
Usually it was in a you know in a module

145
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:42,431
Sorry a model that popped up

146
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,015
And you could change it right there on the same page

147
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:50,623
Now you simply go to another view and is basically doing the same

148
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,903
So

149
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:57,279
You just do that the same goes with your admin view custom view site view

150
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,583
And basically everything else

151
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
The contributor is we've moved down here so you could

152
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,703
Do them on the page

153
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:10,591
But for most of the other repeatable Fields we've moved them to their own tables

154
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,919
The Fields and the folders we've moved

155
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,455
To a joint table

156
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:17,247
So if you were to click on that

157
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
You should be able to

158
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,599
Easily add

159
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,903
Some files to your

160
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
Component or folders

161
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
All found within this

162
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,047
Structure

163
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
As it's explained here in the

164
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:33,887
Note

165
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,751
The same is true of all the other

166
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:41,567
Areas it's basically

167
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
We've moved

168
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:44,639
The

169
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,431
Admin views to

170
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,967
It's Town tab

171
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,343
So you could access them via this button or via this one

172
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
And so here you would see your changes you could also actually from here directly edit

173
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,023
The admin View

174
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,047
That you've linked

175
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
So

176
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
It will be able to

177
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,471
Edit the admin view directly out of your component area

178
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
And

179
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
So

180
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,823
That That's a nice new feature

181
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,847
Which

182
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,151
I suppose will come in very handy

183
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,343
Ok so that is really the new upgrade

184
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,647
As really targets

185
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:31,999
The majority of the changes is in the Joomla component area

186
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
We do

187
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
Have a lot of data checks all around JCB at this stage

188
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,215
That if during the upgrade we might have missed a

189
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:45,567
Field in not converting it to the new subform layout

190
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:52,223
Then even when just opening a view it actually runs through all those fields

191
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,015
And make sure that it's been

192
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,319
You know changed and converted

193
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
If by any means you didn't get around to opening the views and you just go here

194
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
To the compiler

195
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:07,071
And would click compile

196
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
It actually

197
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:11,935
Does that again it runs through all the fields

198
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
And it makes sure that it's in the right format

199
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
And therefore you're compiling should work just as before

200
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:19,615
Now

201
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:22,943
What are the new features we've added is this

202
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:24,991
Translation checker

203
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:30,367
Which basically checks how many strings there is within your component

204
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,463
And how many you've translated for this specific version

205
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,535
New language available

206
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
For both the front

207
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,191
You know sorry the admin view the admin system view the site view

208
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,311
And again for the another language Admin view admin system view in the site view

209
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
So basically giving you

210
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,199
A little feedback on your progress

211
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:59,295
Because we realised that this area of JCB is not

212
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,367
May be utilised as much as it

213
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Can be

214
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415
So we bakes

215
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,207
Making some awareness here

216
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,999
But this area is available

217
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:14,655
It only comes and becomes Active if you've actually got some language translation as sorry some languages

218
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
set up

219
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,495
So you need to have some languages in your

220
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
Languages area

221
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:25,919
And you need to have have compiled that component at least once before

222
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:29,503
Because like you know by now that the

223
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:35,135
The the language string stored in JCB found on the language translations

224
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,743
Is only generated once you've compiled at least your component once

225
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:44,351
Then it links the component language strings to JCB

226
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
And you can translate them into those languages that you created

227
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:54,335
The other problem which you now saw their with which regarding to The Back-up folder

228
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:59,455
Because I haven't setup a backup folder for this JCB install

229
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
It'll tell me if I leave the set to yes and I compile he'll tell me that it couldn't move that

230
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
Backup file

231
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,975
Because the temporary folder and the backup

232
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Folder is now the same place

233
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,583
So basically it's saying it couldn't move

234
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,887
The file to the same location

235
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,727
And that means this is not really an error

236
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:24,031
It's just a mis configuration

237
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:28,895
Because we haven't setup The Back-up folder to be a separate folder from the temporary folder

238
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:34,015
And then if you need some more help regarding the translation manager

239
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,063
And please go watch this tutorial

240
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:38,879
Here we do give you a notice the

241
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,951
that you can even in the options area of JCB

242
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,047
You can change the percentage of translation required

243
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:48,351
Before a translation is added

244
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Currently it's set to 50%

245
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:53,727
Which is actually not

246
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:59,871
You know set in stone you can change that to any percentage that you like

247
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,015
Ok so that is creating a component now with the new upgraded JCB

248
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,575
And having just compiled that

249
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
We can go back here

250
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927
We can see that the component was built

251
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,279
And everything is working as expected

252
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,631
Yeah so thank you for watching this tutorial

253
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:27,263
If you run into any issues that you think is related to this upgrade

254
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:31,103
And you have already cleared your browser memory

255
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,687
Also note that I'm I'm using

256
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,223
Firefox here

257
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Let see

258
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
Firefox

259
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
64-bit

260
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
Here we go

261
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Then please

262
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,911
Open an issue on GitHub and we'll try to get back to you and see if we can get this resolved

263
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:59,519
So far my experience is that this upgrade

264
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:02,335
Is taken JCB into

265
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,615
A very

266
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,407
Powerful position

267
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:09,503
Where it is now having No repeatable Fields anywhere

268
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
In the in the component

269
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:14,367
All is repeatable Fields have been converted

270
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,671
And is now only subforms

271
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,463
And

272
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,791
We've added some nice shortcuts like you seen

273
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:28,447
To these decoupled areas which means you can actually access them directly without going through

274
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:30,239
The component view itself

275
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
If you wanted to

276
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Work on for example

277
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,479
The component dashboard

278
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:43,039
You know you wanna make some changes to the dashboard

279
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
Or you wanna just work on the admin views

280
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,927
You can click on that link right here

281
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,535
And work on the admin views without going to the component directly

282
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Which I think is

283
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,143
Very nice Convenience shortcut

284
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:02,495
Which I suppose we'll make our life a little easier

285
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:03,775
Ok

286
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:04,799
Well

287
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,335
Again thank you for watching
