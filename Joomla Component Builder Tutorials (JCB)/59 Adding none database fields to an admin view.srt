1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,072
We've added a new function

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:07,168
To JCB which allows you to add a field

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:08,960
to a view

4
00:00:09,728 --> 00:00:12,288
Without adding the field to the database

5
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,592
Now when will that be useful

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,128
Usually

7
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:20,736
When you have a field which maybe is getting data from another table

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
And

9
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:27,904
You want to actually change the behaviour on the page based on the data selected

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,232
But that selection itself isn't relevant

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,072
Or when you want to actually combine two fields

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,888
As one in the database

13
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,960
Then you could have both fields on the page

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,312
And on submission in your save area in the admin View

15
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:49,152
You can add some custom PHP script

16
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:51,712
To take the value from that other field

17
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,504
And actually

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,552
Save it in to this

19
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
Field that you intend to

20
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,416
Combine the two values

21
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:05,280
And so you don't want both values to be stored in the database

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:11,168
Or the other option is you have fields on a page which

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,264
Actually only get used to generate data in another table

24
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,640
So when you save that item it takes those values put it into

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
The other table

26
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,736
And basically

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,296
Leave just one value in this table

28
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:32,160
Which next time you open it up all those fields are hidden based on that value selection

29
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
Something like that

30
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,328
So it's really got multiple implementations and sort of helps you to get

31
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
A subform on the page

32
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,680
Or any kind of other field type

33
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,008
To be able to you know use it

34
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Once

35
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,384
You know what use it within your custom scripting either in JavaScript

36
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,176
Or in PHP

37
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,552
A previously this wasn't possible if you add a field to view it always gonna get

38
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,600
Stored into the database

39
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:02,880
But now

40
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:05,184
If you go to admin views

41
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:07,744
And

42
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,024
You well

43
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,864
Let's take one

44
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,680
That has this function going

45
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,984
We use the admin view

46
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,288
Fields

47
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:26,176
So you'll see that this new

48
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
Feature is

49
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,040
Replaced your admin view list option

50
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,856
Because now you got show in list

51
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:37,184
And then you have the default which was the previous

52
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,232
Check or uncheck option

53
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
Which basically is 1 and 0

54
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632
But now you got a third one

55
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,448
Which is called No DB

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:55,872
I have a field called not required which basically is what you would usually add

57
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
If you are using

58
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
Conditional JCBs

59
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
Internal conditional option

60
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,904
And you have Fields that actually are required

61
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,744
But within certain criteria those fields are hidden

62
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
And obviously then not required

63
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,376
Then I'm using this not required field

64
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,752
To basically Store Some values with JavaScript that upon submission

65
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,080
It did adapts the validation on the server side

66
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:27,616
Now

67
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,456
I don't really want that value in the database so I'm using this

68
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,504
Non DB option

69
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:38,112
If you changed any other Fields I'm just gonna do demonstration

70
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,208
Obviously I do want this field in the database but just to sort of show you

71
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,512
If you select no DB

72
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,584
It will automatically give you this notice

73
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,144
Basically these two notices

74
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,216
The one saying the non DB option

75
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:57,056
Will remove this field from being saved in the database

76
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
And then this one

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,456
Only use the non DB option if you're planning on targeting this field

78
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
With JavaScript or custom PHP

79
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,160
To move it's value into another field that does get saved

80
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
to the database

81
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,256
In one form or another basically saying to you

82
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,607
But if you use this value we not gonna store whatever is placed

83
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,375
In it

84
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,423
In the database for you

85
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,959
You will need to manually

86
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:25,983
Do that

87
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
So that's really why it's there it's really for custom

88
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:33,151
customization to your components behaviour

89
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:37,247
And so you'll see that also clears out

90
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:40,319
All your selections because None of these features

91
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Will be

92
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,951
Of you know be used well a vailable to this field

93
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Because this field

94
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
After saving

95
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
Dumps is value and it doesn't exist

96
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
Unless you grab it and

97
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,935
you know

98
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,983
Use it into your script

99
00:04:59,007 --> 00:04:59,775
Ok so

100
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
If you use the list option

101
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,663
We now have this automated

102
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,943
Counter adding

103
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:07,967
So

104
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:11,551
Every time you do that if counts all the fields that are available

105
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Already in your script

106
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,903
And then it adds the next

107
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
Logic number

108
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:22,815
But anyway that's Beyond of what I'm actually explaining or demonstrating

109
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
So for now

110
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,631
Our

111
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,423
Purpose here

112
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,239
Is to show you that there is a new

113
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,519
No DB

114
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,079
Field behaviour

115
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:37,151
Which Some of you have been requesting

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
And I also needed it in the past

117
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,295
So it's available now

118
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,343
You can try it out play with it

119
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
And of course if it doesn't make sense to you just don't use it

120
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,999
Ok well thanks for watching
