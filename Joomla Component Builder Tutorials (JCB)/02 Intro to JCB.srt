00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:02,304
Hi

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:03,584
Welcome

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:06,400
My name is Llewellyn van der Merwe

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:09,472
I'm the developer of component builder for Joomla

5
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,032
I would also be

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,336
Giving you the instructions of how to use it

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,896
Just wanna look at a few issues

8
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
Component-Builder was built

9
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,736
to those who know PHP

10
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
If you don't know PHP there are some

11
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
Great places to

12
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:26,624
Start

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,416
Learning from and one

14
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,464
To those I would mention is

15
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,488
Lynda.com

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,512
And udemy

17
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:37,888
You could go on to their websites and you can simply search for PHP

18
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,680
And you would find

19
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,216
tons of courses

20
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
that I suppose would

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,080
do more than enough to to get you on your way

22
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
If you don't know CSS JavaScript HTML then certainly you need to go visit these website

23
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,040
And get that knowledge

24
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,880
It was not developed for those who

25
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,928
Have no but developing skills

26
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,488
Because

27
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,816
Simply I developed it actually for myself

28
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,120
As developer of components

29
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:12,192
So that I can easily and quickly get

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,984
Most of the bulk of the code done

31
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,080
And I could just be focused on the actual custom

32
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
Code which

33
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
Goes beyond the norm

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,480
So that's what it's really made

35
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,248
To do

36
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:29,344
If you don't have an understanding of the Joomla API

37
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,136
It's only gonna be to your own

38
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,928
Disadvantage

39
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:36,768
It's not that difficult to get it understanding

40
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
You just need to be able to read PHP

41
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
And open

42
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
a Joomla website go to libraries start reading with

43
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,448
Classes

44
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,776
Even go to Joomla's own components

45
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,568
That means

46
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,848
you would Simply

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,200
Go to a Joomla install that's this one here

48
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:59,296
And you go to components and you would go to

49
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,344
Content manager

50
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
Look at its folder structures

51
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
then open

52
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,024
obviously if you know cmv

53
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
And there's the controllers there's the models there's

54
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
 the Views

55
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,400
Open a view

56
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:17,472
Start opening the script itself

57
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
Read through it

58
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,056
If using NetBeans

59
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:23,616
You can hold onto a function like that one

60
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Press Ctrl shift

61
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,480
It'll show you where

62
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,528
In your Joomla website

63
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
That function is declared

64
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
And

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
You can

66
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
You can open that file

67
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
And you can let's see I think you click there

68
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,304
Open source in editor

69
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
there we go

70
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
And you can start

71
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
By doing these kind of things

72
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,520
You can start learning in the way that the code

73
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,080
Connects to each other

74
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
Through just looking at Joomla's own

75
00:02:58,432 --> 00:02:59,200
Components

76
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:04,320
Basically that's how I got to know how things work I simply went here

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,112
Helper content control shift

78
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,952
and Then opened

79
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,256
that in the next window

80
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Look through the

81
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:14,560
Class

82
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,840
Methods

83
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
class variables

84
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:21,216
Which ones that is extending

85
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,520
This one isn't extending any

86
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
So

87
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,128
That's how I got to know how most things work

88
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:29,664
And

89
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,040
That's also how most other developers I suppose are able to get their hands on this

90
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,160
And so the better you know the Joomla API

91
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:42,464
To the more advantage to yourself

92
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:49,376
Because you will understand that this application is really implementing the API itself over

93
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:50,144
and over

94
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,008
I didn't reinvent things I'm trying to stay as close to the conventions

95
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
as possible

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
And as I become aware of

97
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,640
Better ways of implementation

98
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
I would like to

99
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
At that again

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,504
So even if you know a better way to doing it

101
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,040
Please communicate with me

102
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
I would likely

103
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Updatening

104
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
include and change

105
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
Whatever is needed

106
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
You must be willing to get your hands dirty it is not one of the issues

107
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,815
that are quite important

108
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,655
This simply means that if you have built something and it doesn't work

109
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
You need to debug it

110
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
Which means

111
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,103
Possibly you would like to run a local Sandbox environment

112
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
I'm running here on Ubuntu

113
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
Is my local sandbox

114
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,015
And so

115
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
I have

116
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,367
PHP on it and

117
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:43,647
Got

118
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
My sequel installed

119
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,255
and Joomla

120
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:51,327
So if I was to open a browser

121
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
And

122
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,655
I would type in

123
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:58,495
this Local

124
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
This is my local install so you can see I just typed in VDM

125
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,175
And I have

126
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:08,479
Basically a few sites here

127
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:11,295
Test one is one we'll be working in

128
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
And

129
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
The one in which Component-Builder is being developed

130
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Is this Component Builder 1

131
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,719
And

132
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
those sites have admin so this is just my own little

133
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:25,375
Script that I've dumped onto my own little server

134
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:27,423
And I can now

135
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:28,703
Change that

136
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:29,983
Say

137
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Ok

138
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,311
Let's go to

139
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,335
Builder dot

140
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
VDM

141
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
That's another

142
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,943
Site

143
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,247
And it's loading some of the

144
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:42,527
Test

145
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,087
Displays that I'm working on

146
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
And I add

147
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Administrator do that

148
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,975
Open the back end

149
00:05:51,743 --> 00:05:52,511
And I can login

150
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:54,815
So I'm running in a Sandbox environment

151
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,351
And what this

152
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,167
The advantages as you don't have any internet

153
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
Involvement

154
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
those of you that already do it know all these advantages but those of you don't

155
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,407
You you can basically work offline mostly

156
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
And

157
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
And as well you can

158
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:12,991
add

159
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,039
Things like XDbug

160
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,319
And other script

161
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
Which help you debug

162
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,415
Your application very easily

163
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:24,767
We doing that in online developing sorry

164
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,559
Off-site environment is

165
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,583
Time consuming and

166
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Difficult and

167
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,375
Expensive

168
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:35,007
So it's much easier doing it offline and again if you don't know how to do that

169
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Please visit Lynda.com and

170
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,895
Look at a course called I think it was

171
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
Up and running with PHP Linux developer Linux server

172
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Running my next 

173
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,415
Wait let me quickly go find out hold on

174
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,327
Ok here we have it up and running with Linux for PHP developers by Jon Peck

175
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,399
Is an excellent course to get your own

176
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
Local

177
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
Developing environment setup

178
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
I don't know this

179
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
URL is gonna be helpful

180
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,663
But there it is

181
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,503
 Apache-tutorials up and running

182
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,807
Linux PHP developers

183
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
and

184
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
I'm sure if you've watched this I've watched it

185
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,439
Any

186
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
Moons ago

187
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,535
And it's been very helpful

188
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,071
To get my

189
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,351
Initials

190
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Sandbox setup

191
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,423
Obviously since then

192
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,031
And I suppose with yourself as well you'll find it you you get better

193
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:41,823
And you find better ways

194
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,871
But it's a good place to start

195
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:47,711
Ok so that is about getting your hands dirty

196
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:51,551
Component builder best place of

197
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
Function of being functional is offline

198
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:00,511
If you gonna do it online please realise that there might be security risks

199
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
Especially when you've compiled

200
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,095
An application

201
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,935
It places it into your temporary folder which can be accessed

202
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:08,959
From

203
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,495
From anywhere

204
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,079
Anyone can access your temporary folder on your

205
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:15,359
Server

206
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,151
Of your website

207
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,175
So

208
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,063
Yes you can delete the application from there in mediately with a button which are show you later

209
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:30,719
But it is still I feel unsafe and the purpose of the application was

210
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:37,119
Live in a developing environment where you have Joomla installed and where you can really test it

211
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
intensly

212
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,983
So I would still suggest it None the less you do it that way

213
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
Ok now

214
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Finally we almost there

215
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
Finish with the introduction since it's free please help me to ensure the future

216
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,759
 of this component

217
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:58,367
By not sharing it's training videos online

218
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:04,767
or with anyone else this is really the only way that I can sustain this

219
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
Development

220
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,351
is if you

221
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:13,471
Don't share these videos so please if you be so kind

222
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,871
If you have an organisation or you your a company and you have a

223
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Others that's gonna view it

224
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:28,063
I suppose I can't stop you from doing that but I would encourage you there for then

225
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
to consider making a contribution when you are starting to reap the benefits of

226
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:40,863
The time that this application saves you so that this application can be further developed for the rest of the

227
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:43,935
The community and also for yourself

228
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:50,335
We would like to also involve you on Github so you can go to GitHub

229
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
/VDM

230
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
- IO

231
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
/ Joomla component builder

232
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,087
Basically this place here

233
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
And if you if you have issues or any requests or anything really

234
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:12,095
Please come here and go to issues and open a new issue

235
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,239
I want to be sure you can do that if you've got an account of course with GitHub

236
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:24,639
And then we at least our discussions you are logged and it's public and others can see it and 

237
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:27,455
We can also come back as do it in reference

238
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:34,111
If you want to make a feature request then you can start

239
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:37,439
That feature request obviously herein the issues

240
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
And possibly if it exist I'll point you out to it and if a training is needed we will add it to this training

241
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:50,239
Video set but if there is a feature request that has started here

242
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:56,639
and you feel that you you can't wait because we possibly will create milestones and we will add

243
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:03,039
feature requests to milestones in you wanna ensure that a feature request ends up being done

244
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:09,439
Before anyone else is then you need to communicate with me at this email and I can send you

245
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,047
a link to to make a donation or a

246
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
Yeah I'll give you an invoice even if needed so that we can ensure that feature request be done

247
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:21,727

00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:37,599
