1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:05,888
Ok we've got a very exciting new

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,936
Option available in JCB

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:12,800
Make sure you're on version 2.9.3 for this

4
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:15,104
We're at beta release now

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
It's already working and the tutorial

6
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,248
Is made during this period

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
But

8
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:28,928
Soon as we've got tested and stable we'll push it up I need to make this tutorial now

9
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:32,000
Because those tested need to

10
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,560
Know how it works ok

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,632
Basically

12
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:41,472
The past this area field types

13
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,080
Has got all the field types that Joomla has by Default

14
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
And you could extended by adding other field types that Joomla already

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:57,088
Has but except this one field called custom

16
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
This field has always been a jack of all trades if you will

17
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,048
You can do

18
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,352
Basically almost everything

19
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:11,680
Because it can extend

20
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
3 types of fields

21
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:18,080
And you can then dynamically generate the

22
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,872
Input values

23
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
So if you would open the custom field

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,224
You would see

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,016
It has a

26
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,832
Option here called

27
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Extends

28
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
And has three options here list radio checkbox

29
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
And those are the three jform field subclasses that can be extended with

30
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,376
This custom field

31
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:45,216
Default use a list and that always works well

32
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
Now

33
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,616
What we've done is we broken out of the box

34
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,968
I made a previous tutorial explaining how custom Fields work

35
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,504
And

36
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,808
Also how you could expand it

37
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
By adding

38
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:03,648
Files

39
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:08,512
Making changes to the core which I realize is not a good practice

40
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:15,168
And so we took some counsel and we've decided to add

41
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:21,568
The option to expand custom Fields inside JCB without touching the core

42
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:25,152
And I trusted this would

43
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:30,784
Yeah be very powerful for some of you that wanna go Beyond the default

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,368
So let's see how this works

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,904
Basically

46
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
All of these field types that are really exist

47
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,792
Mapped pack to

48
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,840
Joomla field types

49
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,376
Now

50
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:47,424
Except this one as I said

51
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,752
This one has special features

52
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:53,056
It actually creates a new file

53
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Which

54
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,128
Can be then

55
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,664
Overwriting

56
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,224
The default Joomla field types

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,272
Now first of all

58
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:07,648
The field types are declared in the library area of your Joomla core

59
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,696
So let's quickly look at that.

60
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
So if you look at your Joomla website you've got your

61
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:18,144
Root here administrator components and then you got libraries

62
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:21,472
Then you have a Joomla

63
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,776
Folder at the moment in Joomla 3

64
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:27,872
And it has a form folder with a Fields folder

65
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
and here is a whole lot of fields

66
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Then there's also

67
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,624
A source folder also again with a form folder and fields folder in

68
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,928
A whole lot of other fields

69
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,744
All of these Fields extend

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,280
Some other field

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
So you can see that here for example jform field list is being extended by contentlang field

72
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:54,240
Many of these field types are

73
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:57,824
Joomla core related within the source where is the others

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,872
These with in Joomla

75
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:05,248
Are basically the default Fields that you see mapped out in JCB

76
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:11,392
Now we are extending this field which extends the form field

77
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:14,464
So you have basically jform field list

78
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
that has being extended

79
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:20,351
And then we also extending the radio

80
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,679
Field this one jform field radio

81
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:29,823
And we are also so that you can see it is extending various field types

82
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:35,711
So this is the place where you can come and say you know what

83
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
I wanna create my own custom custom field like Beyond

84
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:46,207
What JBS custom field already stands for so for our example we can

85
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,487
Take note for example

86
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,023
Let's say you want to

87
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
Expand on the Note field type

88
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,655
So you can come here

89
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
And you can look at

90
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,263
All it's values we get label

91
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:03,615
And the get input now the get input it should be

92
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:08,735
This ok but the get label you might want to overwrite this

93
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
In that case I mean you could

94
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,879
You could take any of these field types

95
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,415
Literally any

96
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,999
And you can take any of these methods

97
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
And I'll show you now

98
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
How to use this to write your own custom field type right in the JCB

99
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,471
Interface

100
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,799
And you no longer limited to what we have done

101
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
You can use any one of these and make your own field type now there's a difference between a

102
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,991
Field type and a field

103
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
And I know in

104
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
My initial tutorials I sometimes may have left a little confusion there but just that you know

105
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,511
Is most certainly a difference between a field type

106
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:53,791
And a field

107
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
Field is what ends up being used in your component is a field type is what is used to build

108
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,495
The field ok

109
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,287
Enough of that

110
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,103
We can extend meter

111
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,663
We can extend colour

112
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,223
We can we can really extend anything

113
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:16,575
I think to give it the best demonstration note won't be ideal

114
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
I think I should instead

115
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,647
Use list

116
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:26,303
I know list already exist but list has get input and it has get

117
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,327
Options

118
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
And it has add options

119
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
And

120
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
It is it has

121
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:39,871
Multiple options in currently in JCB You Could Only target the get options area

122
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,759
You cannot overwrite the input area and you cannot overwrite

123
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
The

124
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,599
Add options area

125
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:53,183
So having said that we can

126
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
Now actually do that

127
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
So

128
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:09,567
Let's show you how that's done first of all we go to custom

129
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,615
Component type field type

130
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Custom we open it

131
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,295
Now we decide what are we going to do here what are we gonna extend now there's only one

132
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
Value

133
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
That you must set right

134
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,023
Well there are few but this is the one that trips the switch ok

135
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:31,071
And it's this name value

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,399
You can call it anything you like

137
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,239
But it must have an @ sign in it

138
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:42,335
So you could say for example list

139
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,871
@

140
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
And maybe

141
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
It's about

142
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
Some kinda list that you you gonna be using often and it has specific purpose for now I'm just gonna call it

143
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
Mine it's just simple

144
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
So list@mine this @

145
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:03,071
Doesn't need to between doesn't need to be between words it can be in the beginning

146
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,375
Can be in the end can be anywhere

147
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:07,167
But it has to be there

148
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:12,287
This little @ is what makes it different from every other field type

149
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:16,895
And what makes JCB know that this is a custom custom field

150
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,919
Beyond

151
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:23,807
normal custom so basically tells JCB this is your own custom field

152
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
You can keep this values as it is

153
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:30,463
You could take values away

154
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:33,279
I would suspect that there are some values that

155
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
You know you can't

156
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:41,215
Remove like the type the name the label and this will depend on what field type your extending on right

157
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,847
Most of the time the type must always remain because this must be a

158
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:53,247
Unique value that eventually gets used if you're using a custom field if it's a

159
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
Custom list field this cannot be list

160
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
Remember Joomla already has a list field option type you know field type

161
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:09,119
So you must use unique names so this could be you know my list like that

162
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:12,447
But it cannot be list ok now

163
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
If it's adjustable you can tick this

164
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,823
If it's not adjustable leave it unticked

165
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
And all this

166
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
You can

167
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,991
Change the description here you can do whatever you like

168
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,623
I'm gonna leave a lot of this right the way it is because it sort of makes sense

169
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,671
Here

170
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:35,231
We need to leave list there

171
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
And

172
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
We we need to tell those who maybe have staff or other using JCB in house

173
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,239
So the options are

174
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:53,919
Only list because you are extending list you want

175
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,527
This to work in list you might wanna use the table

176
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,807
Placeholder

177
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
Component placeholder The View placeholders

178
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
That's all up to you

179
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,975
Let me

180
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
I mean you can read here how to access the table value in your PHP

181
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,703
That you're going to add

182
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:22,591
I'll show you a little of that again let's just keep that in the back of your mind one little

183
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
Reality though

184
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:27,711
Is the button option do not work here

185
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,759
If you want it to work

186
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,807
You must manually code it

187
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,575
So best

188
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,343
Remove it

189
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:34,879
OK

190
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:39,487
So I'm not gonna need all of these above values

191
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,023
Because I'm gonna

192
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Well you know what

193
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:44,095
Let me leave

194
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,375
This one

195
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
And maybe yeah

196
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Remove the rest

197
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:51,007
Just to show you how it works

198
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:56,895
You can remove this I'm gonna leave Prime now you see that there is this

199
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
PH type PHP

200
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:03,807
Every one of these values represent a line in the code

201
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:10,975
And this value here is what's gonna show you in the interphase what the code is for

202
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,511
So

203
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:17,375
Basically you need to update this area for your new implementation

204
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Now

205
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:25,055
All the options available because obviously you might wanna have different areas for different code

206
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:25,823
Right

207
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,359
So

208
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:31,967
Let me show you how the code gets taken into the compiler

209
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,991
So

210
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:39,391
Just before we do that all of this actually ends up in the value called type PHP

211
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,975
Ok even 19 all of these values

212
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
It gets It's basically like 4 lines 5 - 6 you need to add each line

213
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
On its own number

214
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
You can't

215
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:58,847
Have a just like this you can't do that now multiple lines this area only takes one line

216
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,871
at a time

217
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:06,271
That was unfortunately how we ended up doing it it's not a problem though because

218
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Lot of room here

219
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
You can add as many lines as you like

220
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,135
Ok

221
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
So

222
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:18,559
Before we continue with this area let me go show you what is available because obviously

223
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:21,887
Like I said this is one position

224
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,191
So that show you that

225
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,591
JCB now has a new value called PHP field array

226
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
The first option is the one

227
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
Which we'd looked at already

228
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,735
This basically

229
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,783
Is

230
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Referring

231
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,879
To let me show you

232
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:44,927
to

233
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
Type PHP this value here because it doesn't add anything value a means type

234
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
PHP a

235
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
So this value

236
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:56,447
Represents that value

237
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:02,847
And so it goes on all the way to n and then x so there's also a

238
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
X

239
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,431
PHP type

240
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,551
So you have basically 16 fields

241
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:15,647
Input Fields available in your custom field area

242
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
You could target the normal basic default one which Now looks like this right you

243
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,703
Saw that 1 and 2 and 3 and 4 or you can add a second

244
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Value

245
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,007
Make it a

246
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,823
And then you have one

247
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,103
Sorry

248
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:42,015
One and two and three and four and as many as you need lines so you have a PHPa

249
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:48,415
phpb c, els all the way and that's all the available

250
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Placements

251
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:56,863
Now I'm gonna add 3 so you can see it being demonstrated we couldn't use the First

252
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,423
And then these two you could use any

253
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:05,823
There's no real it's just what is available at the moment I thought 16 is way more than that we need but

254
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Ok

255
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Let's say we want to Target

256
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,455
just 3 areas in

257
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
This

258
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,039
Because we gotta overwrite

259
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,831
Certain methods

260
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:17,599
And

261
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,623
Maybe

262
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,159
This

263
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,951
This this value

264
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
This value

265
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:27,327
Is being done dynamically by

266
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,863
No sorry not this value

267
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,887
This value

268
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,423
and the

269
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
Obviously what is being extended

270
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:35,007
Is being done dynamically

271
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:41,663
So that means you only need to Target this either this

272
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Area

273
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
Or this area

274
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
OK

275
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,623
That's that's the areas you you might want to Target

276
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Ok

277
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,671
So

278
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,951
Now

279
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,071
You can use these various

280
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:02,655
Values to Target those various areas

281
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:09,311
And to show you exactly how that will work out let me demonstrate it to you in the interface

282
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:14,175
So first of all I'm gonna choose this this

283
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:14,943
Type

284
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,479
PHP

285
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,039
To overwrite the

286
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,367
Method to get the field options

287
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,903
So

288
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:29,279
I want to actually add the comment to that so I'm gonna start by replacing

289
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,071
That with a comment

290
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
Beginning of the comment

291
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,655
Second one

292
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,239
I'm copy pasting this

293
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
So you

294
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Just the second one

295
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:44,895
Then I want a little space there

296
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
So

297
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,967
just paste that in there

298
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:51,807
And then the next comment line

299
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,111
Which is basically the

300
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,159
Return value

301
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,463
then

302
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
The next one is

303
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
I'm gonna add this

304
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
Basically copy this from Joomla

305
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:07,935
I'm leaving that there just for

306
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,727
my own understanding

307
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
And then close the comment area

308
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:19,199
And then open the method which is a protected method

309
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,527
Get Options

310
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,855
Now

311
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:28,415
I don't think I want to have this protective

312
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:34,047
I'm gonna make this public and if if you

313
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,631
Public at the moment

314
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
And that is because I like I explain in the previous tutorial of custom fields

315
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:46,591
This function

316
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,639
This method is being called

317
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,919
To populate

318
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:52,223
Many selections  across JCB

319
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,623
Now I see that the new list method since Joomla 3 we look at that

320
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,951
Since Joomla 3.7 it has this

321
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:08,351
Class called get underscore get a magic class to actually get the

322
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,631
Options

323
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,655
And

324
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:16,543
I should actually update JCB to Target this this method instead

325
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,079
And then

326
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,383
That will be the

327
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,431
Better way to go about this

328
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:27,295
But at the moment it doesn't do that

329
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,087
And so

330
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
It's just best

331
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
To just make this

332
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
Public for now ok

333
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
So I'm making it public

334
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
Then

335
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
I am

336
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:47,263
Adding the opening brace for the method

337
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:51,103
For now please cause I'm just demonstrating this

338
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
I'm gonna add a little

339
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,407
Comment

340
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,455
Inside of the method

341
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,295
And then I'm just going to close the method

342
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,087
And remove

343
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
All other

344
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:06,207
Lines so basically have 10 lines

345
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,863
Now to make sure that this is what shows up in the UI  I'm gonna replace all these

346
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
Notes

347
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,447
With the

348
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,727
Same

349
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
Needs to be the same for this

350
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,567
For this

351
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Collection of code

352
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:30,271
So we have our first collection or method then set

353
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,087
Now the second one

354
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
Before I continue because I know

355
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Something can go wrong here

356
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:40,767
So I'm gonna save save as copy we opened the custom field to start with

357
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
I'm gonna call this

358
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
My

359
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,631
Own

360
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Cust

361
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Cust

362
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,007
custom list field

363
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
OK

364
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
And maybe

365
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:56,383
just paste that in here as well

366
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,175
And save as copy

367
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,223
So now I have a new

368
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:03,295
Field type called list@mine

369
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,087
And

370
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,647
Basically has these values

371
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,183
Including

372
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
This

373
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,231
Now

374
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,511
I can

375
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
Over here

376
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
Add a placeholder 123

377
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,591
Come_

378
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,615
component

379
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
123

380
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:33,247
This is a place holder

381
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:36,831
Which whatever value the user puts in here

382
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Will be updating

383
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,535
This place holder over here so I'm just gonna do that just to show you how that happens

384
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,167
And I'm also gonna explain to you where this comes from and how you can

385
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,703
Expand on this

386
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
Ok so

387
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,823
Now we wanna do a

388
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
Second one

389
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
And

390
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,967
We gonna call this

391
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,991
Type

392
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
Must be type PHP always

393
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,159
Then a

394
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,719
Underscore

395
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:18,815
One because this is the first line of that

396
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:23,423
So again I'll start by it is opening the comment

397
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,007
and add a few lines here I'm going to need a few of them

398
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
And then I'm gonna

399
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,615
Add the next comment line

400
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
And you see that every time I'm

401
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,967
Also adding the tab space here

402
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,807
Because I want this to look you know like it was coded

403
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:42,367
So I'm adding the 10 of spaces in

404
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,647
And

405
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,719
Adding these comment lines first

406
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,639
Hey now we gonna oh

407
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,687
Close the comments

408
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
And

409
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:12,063
Now I'm going to open the

410
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,855
Method

411
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
It's phrase

412
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
I want it to

413
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:25,120
Get the parent HTML as well so I'm just putting a little note there

414
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:28,704
And then grabbing the parent HTML

415
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,056
And then another note that sort of tells

416
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,616
Everyone using this type

417
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
That they can now expand

418
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
With their own code

419
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:44,064
And then I'm going to leave a blank one

420
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,088
Which is just

421
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:48,160
For them easy to start typing and then

422
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,464
I'm going to close the method

423
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,512
Now I need to go up here

424
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
I have to copy this

425
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
Type A

426
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,400
Make it 2

427
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,192
3

428
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:04,544
4 a course you need to do all this just once

429
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,848
And then this type is reusable

430
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:10,176
So you could after you have done this

431
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,808
You can reuse this type over and over so you need to think generic need to think

432
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:22,208
Don't make it to type specific if you do you're gonna have to

433
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,232
make many

434
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,328
I tried to make things that easily can be reused

435
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
so that's sort of a little

436
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,984
Caution ahead of time because I know that

437
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,824
some of field type you want to make it for a specific project

438
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,408
Well think about the option of the

439
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
Making it to be reusable

440
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
in

441
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
Multiple projects

442
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,672
Ok so I'm gonna use that first comment line to

443
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,464
Just

444
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
Give us

445
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
just wait

446
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Iet's make it

447
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,424
More than

448
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:05,728
That first line

449
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,032
Including the 2nd

450
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Like that

451
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
I'm gonna use that as the

452
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
The identifying note

453
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
It needs to all be the same for this

454
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,648
PHP A

455
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,440
Code group

456
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:32,352
You could do a PHP.... B....,C as I showed you earlier there is

457
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,400
Basically

458
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
Wait wait

459
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:46,176
Basically all these available BCD and you basically just need to

460
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:50,784
Add it in front of this PHP type

461
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:57,952
A and so forth don't exceed those that are available at this point If you want to see

462
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:04,352
What is available you go to the Joomla Component helper class this is the Joomla Component

463
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,888
Helper class

464
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
And in it we have a add a PHP fields allowed

465
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:18,432
So I'm gonna just do this too, I mean you get the point we got

466
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,040
The first one which is the basic default and then A

467
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:30,208
And you wanna set this values adjustable

468
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,256
And mandatory

469
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,608
Obviously is not translatable so we can just make this to be adjustable

470
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,224
You make it mandatory it might not come out right

471
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,784
So just leave that unticked

472
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
unadjustable

473
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:57,600
Ok

474
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:02,208
Save and close

475
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
If we now go to a field

476
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,072
And we create a new field

477
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:12,960
And we will see if we're go around to list there's now list@mine

478
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:15,264
It loads that

479
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,824
Settings that we've sent

480
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
And it loads to areas

481
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:25,248
you see methods to get the input markup for a generic list ,that's the comment

482
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,320
And here is the code

483
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:32,928
Ready for you to just start typing in that specific

484
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:36,000
Part if you want to change this area here

485
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:38,816
And here again is the one for the other

486
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,864
The get options

487
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,168
Again it also starts with that

488
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,448
So

489
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
I'm going to add this place holder just in here as well just for demonstration

490
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:57,760
 I'm not gonna add any code I mean you need to know how to do that you need to know how to add that code

491
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:01,344
Otherwise just go back to the basic default

492
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
Custom

493
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:08,512
Field option it has an amazing ability already so this I'm gonna

494
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
Leave it my list simply makes sense I'm gonna also make this my list

495
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,752
And here I'm just gonna say

496
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
A

497
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:23,360
Label

498
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:28,480
And I'm gonna leave the rest just default

499
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,272
And save as

500
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Need to add this at

501
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
Top here

502
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:37,696
Also set the database value let's make it Varchar

503
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
No

504
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
Whatever is making sense with the values that your gonna return from your get options right that's what you

505
00:26:54,592 --> 00:27:00,480
And then save and close and you got your field

506
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,320
Which basically is build on the 

507
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:05,600
list@mine

508
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:08,672
And now you can add it to a Admin View

509
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,280
quite easily I'm just gonna dump it to the demo Admin View

510
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
Let's put it left

511
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,168
In the

512
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,496
Details area make it number 1

513
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,544
Get a

514
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,224
a label shows you the field type that is extended and I think that's enough

515
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:35,040
Let's save and close

516
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
And let's compile

517
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,904
See what happens

518
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Before we do

519
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,304
I wanna now go and show you the whole bit of what happens in the compiler

520
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,656
So that you can understand

521
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,984
Some of that Dynamic placeholder concept I've being

522
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,008
Pointing at

523
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,800
So over here

524
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:01,920
if I go up there's a method here in the

525
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:05,248
JCB 2.9.3

526
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:08,064
Call set custom field type file

527
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,392
And it has a replace array

528
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,440
The replace array

529
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:17,024
Gets the table value if it's set

530
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,328
If it's not set it's an empty value

531
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,912
And it also gets

532
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
The component value

533
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
And add to it too

534
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
com underscore

535
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,848
 component

536
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
And

537
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,200
Checks if it's there in makes it safe and everything

538
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:41,600
And then it has the component, an uppercase views and view plural and

539
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,184
And these are all replacement placeholders

540
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,744
That when we start here at the bottom

541
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:52,864
We start loading the code we are actually using

542
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
The replace

543
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,728
Value

544
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
to

545
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:02,080
Actually update the PHP

546
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:05,408
So all those place holders dynamically get updated

547
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,456
And as you can see

548
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,992
We start the

549
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
The PHP type

550
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:15,392
And we are loading it

551
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,672
One upon another

552
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:23,328
And again add it eventually to a placeholder and it's maybe not necessary  to explain all this but

553
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,144
Basically it is building

554
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:32,288
The values for the file and is adding it there

555
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:36,128
So let's let's see how that file came out

556
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,736
So I'm just gonna compile it here

557
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,272
And then

558
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,296
Install it

559
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
And then this quickly go to demo

560
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:53,792
Looks

561
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,816
new

562
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,864
and it says there

563
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
Label

564
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,448
I have a problem here

565
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,800
Of course if we can open that

566
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,872
We have a few things to

567
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:13,760
 fix so there is our field area there is my list to custom field

568
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,088
So we see if we bring in the list class

569
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,672
It's extending the list calling it my list

570
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
Your options don't return anything

571
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
It's updated to demo component

572
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
See there

573
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,680
And here also your input we didn't even return

574
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,288
HTML That's what we should have done

575
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
So this should...

576
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:49,600
Remember to return the HTML we're gonna save this we can go back to JCB and just

577
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,696
Make some change to that we can see it all happen

578
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:57,024
And here if we refresh this now

579
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,072
Will see that there is 

580
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,120
HTML for that area

581
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:05,472
Now let's tweak it a bit 

582
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,800
I said I was gonna go and do much of that but just so that you can

583
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:15,200
Get the hang of it I'm gonna go back to the actual field types going here

584
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:21,600
And just make a little fix to my field type because I realised I need to

585
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,160
Help others do this right

586
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,440
Gonna add

587
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:27,232
two more fields

588
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
I'm gonna just

589
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,072
Name them here

590
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
15

591
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:38,496
16 and they make this 17

592
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,080
I'm also gonna do so I add it

593
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:48,480
Basically remember HTML I've added those I'm also gonna do something like that in

594
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:50,528
The first one

595
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,368
and add also three more Fields here

596
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
1 just a little extra

597
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Space

598
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
Other

599
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,584
Remember the return options and then here just

600
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:09,728
Return options I think I should add a little thing

601
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,264
Here

602
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,312
So now we have

603
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,384
Options Array, Build Options our little comment

604
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,992
And we need to add a few these 10

605
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
11 12

606
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,024
Ok now also just

607
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:35,328
Move this comment to all of them

608
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,960
I know this is tedious but this is really

609
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,056
at the end of the day not that big of an issue

610
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,872
 just to add this little things

611
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,272
So here we go we've expanded it a bit made it more user friendly

612
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,808
and save and close

613
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,624
Now let's go back to that field

614
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
Add a label

615
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:04,512
And I'm going to

616
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,608
I'm going to click away from it

617
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,984
Click like this one and then save it

618
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:17,056
And then take it back

619
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
To that one

620
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:22,688
Change a

621
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
Few things here

622
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
again

623
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:32,160
Just leave all defaults now you see it loaded

624
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:35,744
The new improvements

625
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,280
And also here

626
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:38,816
So I'm just gonna

627
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,632
 for our purpose say

628
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,776
We need to build the options of course in a specific way

629
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:51,616
And that's the code that you should know how to write but 

630
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:53,152
I am going to add a little bit

631
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Of

632
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:55,968
Custom script here just little

633
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,088
Just option 1 and option 2

634
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:07,488
This obviously you can get these values from anywhere but you need to load it into options

635
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
With their J HTML

636
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
Underscore select option

637
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
implementation

638
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:17,984
So that it loads everything correctly

639
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,032
And then return

640
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,688
here I'm not gonna make a change just maybe let me just do something for the fun

641
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:27,968
of it

642
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,528
and add a little text here

643
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
OK this should work

644
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,520
So I'm basically added a little space

645
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,800
And then

646
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,640
That little bit of text

647
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:59,200
To the input value

648
00:34:59,456 --> 00:34:59,968
You can

649
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,272
Do whole lot of things here if you

650
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,552
What you doing

651
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:07,136
And let's compile and see how it looks

652
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,888
So now if we refresh that we have option 1 option 2

653
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:24,800
And here's our text "Hi there", that's how easy it is now to expand custom-ally

654
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:31,200
Any type of field this is helpful if you have any questions

655
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:36,320
Please ask it on the Forum and

656
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:37,600
Though

657
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Just

658
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
Quickly to show you the file

659
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:44,000
That's how it came out of the file

660
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:47,072
So again you got your

661
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,864
extending the list

662
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,448
Because you left at value

663
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
 over here

664
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
let's just look at that

665
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,136
You left this value over here to be list

666
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,976
you must always leave this extends

667
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:17,536
This is a must value

668
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:20,608
So the app value and this and of course

669
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,400
The type

670
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,496
The name these are the values that you need to keep there

671
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:29,312
Because if you want to

672
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Take it out

673
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
In the

674
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,688
let me just go there

675
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,016
This get fields

676
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
You'll see

677
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,160
That we are testing whether the extent value exists

678
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
And

679
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Then

680
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,816
We are coming down here and we testing this 

681
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:55,680
 own custom is what that at triggers this value to exist

682
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:02,848
If you by accident leave the button there will leave you a note that the button is not supported in this area

683
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,384
And

684
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,432
Then we basically

685
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:08,224
The type

686
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,808
Is determined

687
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
By

688
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,112
Custom

689
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:16,160
that's not important

690
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:21,024
over here you see we used the extends value

691
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
To update this

692
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,864
To place holders

693
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:26,912
These two place holders

694
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,704
Are what is used

695
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:31,008
To to populate

696
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,336
This value here

697
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
And that's value there

698
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,736
If you if you mess up with this extends value

699
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,296
It will mess up these two values

700
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:49,184
So you can see that it here it extends the J form field extends

701
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:53,536
What you put in list radio in whatever of these

702
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,328
Field types you gonna extend

703
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:00,960
Need to make sure that this is the correct value that you add as an extensive value

704
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:05,824
And then the PHP gets added here in the type PHP

705
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:09,664
There is a type,the  type is the name

706
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:10,944
sorry no

707
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,504
It is this value of here

708
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
This type value

709
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,392
That also must be there so it's the name value the type value

710
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:23,232
 of course depending on what type of field you're extending

711
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,280
Then you have a few these

712
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
And then

713
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:29,888
This extends value

714
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,168
Is a must

715
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:37,568
This Prime PHP still functions just like it would in a normal custom field you can read it here

716
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:43,200
You could leave that in or leave it out depending on yourself if you left it in it all function

717
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,296
The same way as in the custom field

718
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:50,112
So the place holders that you can add here

719
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
We have component

720
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,744
Looking at our code in the compiler

721
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
Just go there

722
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,608
Is again

723
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:03,424
We have the text and we have the ID

724
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,776
And we have the code text and code

725
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
And the view type and type

726
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:17,760
And yeah these are the place holders now they correlate to the custom field

727
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
so

728
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,808
If you start

729
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,344
Close out here

730
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,880
Go back to field types

731
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,416
If you start

732
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,464
With a custom field

733
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
Opening the custom of field

734
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
You'll see

735
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
That we have

736
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
Down here

737
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,680
Table

738
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,472
Component

739
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
We have

740
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,312
Field value field

741
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,360
So if we look at this

742
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:45,408
There is

743
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:54,368
The value field and the key field

744
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,184
these two is the name and the ID

745
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
So the value field and the key field

746
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,120
These two values you need to leave them like that because then

747
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:08,448
They will generate these placeholders see text

748
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:10,240
And ID

749
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,800
So if we look at the code

750
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,592
We see there is a

751
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
Text and ID value

752
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:20,224
And they correspond to whatever the user puts in these

753
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
values

754
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:25,856
So that's the field type you might wanna leave these placeholders in there

755
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:29,952
And as well as the component and the table

756
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:34,048
These view values are also useful but

757
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:39,680
They're not really particularly practical when it comes to extending your own custom field

758
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:41,984
But

759
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,568
Like I said you can come in here look at the code

760
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:51,968
Make changes run it and here you could do the var

761
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:52,992
dump

762
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:59,904
But that and then just grab the replace array

763
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
Like that

764
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:07,840
And safe then compile your custom field wherever you implemented it

765
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
And

766
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
Your own custom field

767
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,216
Then check

768
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
All these Place holders

769
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,568
These place holders the B

770
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:22,176
And D place holders basically referred to those brackets

771
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,504
And the placeholder that you see these

772
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,552
And this

773
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,600
Basic refers to the

774
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
hhh

775
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
these hashes there

776
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:40,096
So if you dump this replace array you'll see the available Place holders

777
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:46,496
That you could use in your code dynamically updating values based on those placeholders

778
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:51,616
If you didn't follow what I've explained then maybe it's just best you don't even worry about that

779
00:41:54,943 --> 00:42:01,087
It can work without you using placeholders so you can just dump these so I would always say start with your 

780
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:04,671
 default custom

781
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,279
Field type and then save as copy give it a 

782
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,839
@mine or whatever you want

783
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:15,423
Save as copy and then start expanding on it

784
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:19,519
And changing it changing this , you see these codes

785
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:22,847
Changing whatever it says here

786
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
But do insure

787
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:31,039
to add the @ if you don't you just did this you gonna break stuff

788
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:34,879
Because custom is already there and the

789
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:41,279
You wanna make sure that JCB knows this is your own thing so that @

790
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,559
Is important

791
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,423
And I think that should be it
