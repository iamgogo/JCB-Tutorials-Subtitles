1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,584
I would like to demonstrate a quick

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,912
Way to add a validation rule to a field

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,448
I just now

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:10,240
What's the validation rules

5
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:11,776
Video or

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:12,544
Tutorial

7
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,128
And realzsed wow that's out dated very much so

8
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,248
Since now there already is actually a validation rules area

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,784
In JCB

10
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:28,416
Which really makes it extremely easy to add any type of validation rule

11
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,696
Which 

12
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,744
You would like to do use in your

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Fields

14
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
So

15
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:36,096
Just again what does a validation rule do

16
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:40,448
Well when you submit a form there are fields in that form

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,472
And

18
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,496
Server side

19
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:46,080
You may want to do some validation on that

20
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,104
Specific value

21
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
In that field

22
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
And

23
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:52,224
Validation rule really takes care of that

24
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,528
Basically checks the value

25
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:56,320
Whether it is

26
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
The correct value

27
00:00:57,856 --> 00:00:58,880
And then

28
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:00,416
If it Isn't you can

29
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,696
Pass a

30
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,232
pass a

31
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,536
Basic return false

32
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,840
And if it's correct you 

33
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
Return true which then 

34
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
sets

35
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
The field to continue on saving

36
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
And be stored into the

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Database

38
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:16,800
The field

39
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,872
Validation rules can also be used for other concepts

40
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:24,224
But I won't be explaining much of that now I'll just show you how to set it up and it's

41
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:25,760
Really easy

42
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
Ok so

43
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:33,952
First of course you need to understand where to add them so I'm gonna do grab any

44
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,352
Type of field here let's let's take this name field it's very much used

45
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
All over

46
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:43,936
so I'm gonna open the name field

47
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,264
And and you will see that by Default

48
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,336
There are already a set of validation rules

49
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
That are created

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:53,920
Now

51
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:54,944
There is

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,504
A validation rule called exists

53
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
And

54
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,832
There is 

55
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
A validation rule called

56
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
Unique field

57
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
And some of this is

58
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
Things that we've made

59
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,560
Here in this

60
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
Joomla install

61
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:16,192
And others are part of the Joomla default validation rules

62
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,312
So how to create a custom one with be added to click here create

63
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
New validation rule

64
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
Which should then

65
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,480
Give you this little heads up and if you click ok

66
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
Takes you to this a new validation rule area

67
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,416
And it's gonna say you must add a unique value rule name

68
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,976
Which is really what you need to put into this area

69
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
Here

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,352
So you can say my validation

71
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,680
Which is unique enough and will tell you here

72
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,472
That that rule is fine

73
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Now

74
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
Most the time you wanna also leave yourself a little note say

75
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:54,848
This

76
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,384
Was why

77
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,504
for reasons to understand the purpose of the validation rule

78
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,576
But you may also now

79
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:09,184
You may not know what is the PHP that you need to add here

80
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
What is the

81
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,792
How does a validation rule really look

82
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
So all those default validation rules

83
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,680
That already exist in Joomla are listed here

84
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,240
and this is just a selection thing

85
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
This value doesn't get stored

86
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:28,640
So it's just that you can select one and basically

87
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:31,456
To use it as a base from which to start

88
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,760
Or just to look at the different ways that it's

89
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
Done so let's say we use the email one

90
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:40,928
It basically loads the Joomlas default implementation

91
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:46,560
or validating an email now you can improve on this and call this my email validation

92
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
And that kind of thing

93
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:52,960
And then use this actual validation

94
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
So

95
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,288
Let's say we gonna do

96
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,312
Not this

97
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,080
Let's Let's

98
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
Let's choose another option

99
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:00,640
Let's say

100
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
Exist

101
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Ok let's look at this

102
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
So

103
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,856
It's going to

104
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,136
You'll have to obviously

105
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Read this read

106
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
This PHP here

107
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:15,488
And

108
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,256
Check

109
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:19,071
That this is exactly what you want

110
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,679
I'm not gonna explain this that's not what the tutorial is about

111
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,007
You need to know your PHP coming here

112
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,359
And then basically write out what you want here obviously

113
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,383
They are

114
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Even ways to

115
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,991
 to go reach out to other datasets in

116
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:38,015
Do validation

117
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,831
This could be a very exciting place

118
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
To do some tweaks

119
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,439
And then you would basically click

120
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:51,327
Save and close which will then take you back to the name field Where We Were

121
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,375
And if we now scroll down

122
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
We will now see in this list

123
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
A new validation rule

124
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,031
That's why

125
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
That's the

126
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,079
1 we just made

127
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,639
And if I grab that validation with a just a

128
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,919
Control

129
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,223
See on

130
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,527
on the PC

131
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
You

132
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,575
Can then

133
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903
Scroll up here see is there already and validation rule

134
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
in place for this field no

135
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,023
If you click on the plus of these

136
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
There should be

137
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,607
A valid date option

138
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:29,983
And you can then this paste this validation rule in there

139
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,775
So at the moment

140
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
This

141
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,847
This field is used

142
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:41,247
Like oh too many time times too many places but I'm gonna just use this as an example

143
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
So it it's gonna

144
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
It's gonna still behave the same way

145
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,671
doesn't matter that

146
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
it is used so many places

147
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:55,071
Ok I'm gonna save and close out here and I'm just gonna compile

148
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,143
Any of these components that actually

149
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:58,911
Use

150
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:02,239
That field for example let's 

151
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,055
Let's do component Builder

152
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
That should work

153
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,407
I'm just gonna compile this

154
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,551
Ok I've downloaded the package so let's go look inside that package

155
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,343
To see what was done

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,927
Ok so we go to admin

157
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
and models

158
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,047
And then there is a rules folder we opened that

159
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,887
and we see it has a file in here now called my validation

160
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
And let's open that

161
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,751
And here in my validation

162
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
It's basically extended the form rule

163
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:38,847
And it's added that

164
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
HTML

165
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,431
Sorry PHP

166
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,991
That we wrote basically this chunk over

167
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:45,759
Here

168
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,367
It is added it to the file for us

169
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:51,391
Now

170
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
This my validation

171
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:57,535
Must also now be added to the field right so let's look at that

172
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,351
So we go out of this

173
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Then we go to forms

174
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,423
And

175
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,215
I'm just gonna open this

176
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
Custom admin View

177
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,031
XML

178
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Just any

179
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:12,127
One which I know has a name field in it

180
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,175
And I scroll down and here it is

181
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,455
Name field

182
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,759
And there is my validation

183
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,111
Now you'll see at the top of this file

184
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
It is actually pointing

185
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,951
To the correct rule folder

186
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:30,559
So that it knows that if the rule is not default to Joomla

187
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
It should come and look here

188
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
To find it and so JCB has moved that rule into

189
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,495
The correct Place already

190
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,311
Now let's quickly

191
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:43,359
Look at I just another little

192
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
Small pointer here

193
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,991
And that is the package has a config file

194
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
And if we open the config file

195
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:56,159
We see that it already has that default rule path

196
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,975
As well set in the config file

197
00:07:59,487 --> 00:07:59,999
So

198
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
That means that

199
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
Even if you were to use that field

200
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:08,191
In the configurations of our component it already know

201
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,471
Where to go look

202
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,519
For that component rule

203
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:12,799
Sorry that field rule

204
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:15,359
Ok so that was what it did it

205
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:17,663
We basically created the rule

206
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
And once we have created it

207
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:22,015
We simply added to a field

208
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,319
And JCB automatically

209
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
Grab that code created that file

210
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:30,975
Added that code to the file and everything should just work

211
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:31,999
Out of the box

212
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,583
Well that's how the new validation rule implementation

213
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
Of JCB

214
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
Actually works

215
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
I trust this would be

216
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Informative enough

217
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,287
In helping you all

218
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,359
Using this validation rule area

219
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,407
Like I said before

220
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,735
There there is a way to get to this area

221
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
via the field

222
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:57,599
But is as you can see here is direct access

223
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,159
Just clicking on the validation rules

224
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:02,975
And then there is my validation 

225
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,023
Here is some of the other validations

226
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,815
That we've made custom ones

227
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,351
That a

228
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
That is also in my

229
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Project which is being used

230
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
So

231
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,519
The my validation is the one we did

232
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,335
And anything that we put in here

233
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,895
It's basically gonna add up at

234
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
Be added as class methods to that file

235
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Now

236
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,063
You can always come back and make some tweaks to it

237
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,903
And every where with this validation rule is used

238
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:36,767
Those field will automatically be updated with the changes wants to get compiled again

239
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095
Ok well thanks for watching and enjoy.
