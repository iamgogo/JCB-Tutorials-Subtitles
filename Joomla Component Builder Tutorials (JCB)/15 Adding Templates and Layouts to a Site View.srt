00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,792
Hi

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,608
Now that we've added a dynamic get

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,632
to

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:06,912
A site view

5
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:10,240
And we have looked at how to access the data sets

6
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:11,776
Through the

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,056
Examples snippets

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
We need to understand

9
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:17,152
How layouts and templates

10
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:18,688
Link into site views

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,992
basically to know

12
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,296
What is the site view in the code

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,576
And what is the templates

14
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
What is the layout

15
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,392
In the code itself

16
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
And how

17
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,720
Joomla load those things

18
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
Well

19
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,328
If we go to our example

20
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
component

21
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:38,912
Sermon

22
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:40,448
distributer

23
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
And then

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,032
View

25
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
And preacher

26
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,640
Template

27
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,456
or Tmpl

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,760
You see that there is a

29
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
Default

30
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,064
File

31
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
PHP

32
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,416
And there is a default underscore

33
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
preacher Box

34
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
preacher panel

35
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:05,280
preacher small dot PHP files

36
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,072
A whole list of them

37
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,632
Now those are all templates

38
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:12,960
The reason why we call them templates

39
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,800
It's because of the method by which they are included into the default

40
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,568
File

41
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,384
The Default file is the main file

42
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,200
And That's what we call the site View

43
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:27,040
So everything inside of this file

44
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,320
Is actually build

45
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392
In the side view so let's open the site View

46
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,840
So all this code here in default View

47
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,912
From here to there

48
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:43,936
Is added

49
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,728
To that default

50
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,496
File

51
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,312
So you see it says default View

52
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,384
And the way it adds to templates

53
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,480
It's with this snippet that says this load

54
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,504
Template

55
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,040
Preacher panel

56
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,112
And you can get these snippets

57
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,416
At the bottom of the

58
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,464
Site View

59
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,768
So if you were to scroll down

60
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:14,656
You first with see the layout Snippets and then after them that template snippet

61
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
And scroll down to the one you have

62
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:19,520
Made by

63
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Looking at these names

64
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:25,408
And then here

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,200
Is a Preacher grid

66
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:29,248
List

67
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,040
Table

68
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:32,320
Panel box

69
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,344
Small

70
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
So

71
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,928
That is the snippet that you will use

72
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
You might sometimes

73
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:41,280
Change the way

74
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
possibly stay in the PHP instead of going out

75
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
into the HTML

76
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,240
So by the way that is what is happening up here

77
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,288
If you look at the code

78
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,104
From time to time I go out of the

79
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,432
PHP I go into the PHP with that tag

80
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,248
And I go out of the PHP with that

81
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Then I go in again may go out again

82
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,856
And then I stay out that I'm

83
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,904
Basically in HTML

84
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,928
So here is

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
pure HTML

86
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
And

87
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:12,768
Then

88
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:15,072
Ok this part here is obviously

89
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,096
Uikit

90
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
Class and the implementation

91
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,448
And then I go back into

92
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,472
PHP

93
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
And I go out again and here is HTML again

94
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
So that is a way that you can work with

95
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,664
with PHP

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,688
In the view

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
so if we are going to look at this in the code

98
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:37,088
And we open that default file

99
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,416
you see that exactly what is placed there cimit

100
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
So basically we

101
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
End with PHP there

102
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,584
Then we go into PHP again

103
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,680
And here is the same text that we just looked at in that

104
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Editor

105
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,544
So that text gets placed here and then it through these

106
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:02,688
Snippets it includes the template so basically I'm using a global setting here

107
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:08,320
And I'm checking now this Global setting is set in the components Global settings

108
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,160
And I'm checking what type of display has been set

109
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
And then on the basis of that I either show this template

110
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,095
or That one

111
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
or that one

112
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
in your Template view you have access to the same Global Fields or

113
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
Class Fields and public class methods

114
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:35,967
As you have in the default View

115
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,367
So in the default view we have access to this preacher but the same is true of

116
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
templates these are the templates that I've just opened

117
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:50,047
And you see I'm using the same this params

118
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,071
Here

119
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:56,703
This preacher website so I am using the same Global

120
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,103
Class Fields or values depends on how you wanna call it

121
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:07,199
And that is true of your templates

122
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:09,247
So if we go back to our

123
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Interface the way that component builder knows that it needs to add this template to

124
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
To this site View

125
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
Is simply because of this code snippet

126
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:24,863
 so you place code snippet in there and you'll go look in the template

127
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,143
List

128
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
For a template with this name

129
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,983
and it will simply add it

130
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,079
To that site View now so what I mean

131
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
I mean add it to this

132
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Template with the

133
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,431
In the right folder

134
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
So

135
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,783
You can you can by doing that

136
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,063
Add your

137
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,391
Templates to the site View

138
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:51,999
And will look at setting up templates we also look at setting up

139
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,071
Layouts, layouts work a little different

140
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:59,679
Let me see do I have a layout here in this site View

141
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,823
It seems I'm mostly using templates you can use templates and layouts in the site View

142
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,895
I have just used

143
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,943
Templates mostly it seems

144
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:16,063
And that means that possibly the layouts I've used in the templates View

145
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
But if I wanted to add a template sorry a layout to this view

146
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:29,887
Without doing it inside a template which doesn't matter it's just a way of bundling your

147
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Scripts in a more concise manner so that he doesn't be overwhelming

148
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:40,383
When you look at the code but that you have it

149
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,479
Broken up in pieces

150
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,551
The layout structure is mostly used

151
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,671
When you are dealing with a part of the display area

152
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
That is used

153
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,719
across

154
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:55,999
Other

155
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
Display areas

156
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:01,631
So I usually used the layout structure

157
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:04,447
The moment I'm using a piece of code

158
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,727
In more than one

159
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
View

160
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:09,311
Or in more than one template

161
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
The reality is you could

162
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,895
You could use

163
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,943
Template inside of templates

164
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,015
You cannot use templates inside of layout

165
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
But you can use templates inside of templates

166
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,927
And you can use layouts inside of layouts

167
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,999
But you cannot use templates in layouts

168
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
and so but these are all conventions that are set forth because of the way Joomla implements the structure

169
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
These are not limitations because of component Builder

170
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:43,359
This is just how Joomla does it it will allow you to add templates

171
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,127
to

172
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
The default

173
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,199
Site view

174
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
But

175
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
It will not

176
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,551
Allow you to add

177
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:55,135
 templates to a layout it will just scream at you

178
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
And why

179
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Well the 

180
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:00,255
 easiest way to put this

181
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:01,791
Templates

182
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
Have access to the global values

183
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
All the class values

184
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:07,935
Where is layouts do not

185
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:11,519
You need to pass layout the value that you wanna give it

186
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
Now that's important

187
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,383
Point because if you look at these Snippets

188
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,711
You see that we're just passing it this items

189
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,039
But you can even pass it just this

190
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,599
Or you could pass it

191
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,183
A specific value

192
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
You have your custom classes

193
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:34,303
And you can pass it that specific value

194
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
From your custom

195
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Class

196
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,167
It all depends and when you setup the layout

197
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
You have an area just like this where you select

198
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,775
The

199
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,615
The Dynamic get that you were using in the layout

200
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:51,967
Now that is not gonna add that dynamic get to your side view

201
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,247
or to the model

202
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,551
It just helps you to see the Snippets

203
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
And it helps us to set up

204
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
The snippet for you

205
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,927
So if you've selected the wrong

206
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Code here

207
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,559
In your layout we'll talk about that again when we get to layouts

208
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,399
It will actually just changed the way it looks here

209
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,471
But you can obviously override it you can copy this

210
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
Snippet like that

211
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,335
Put it in your code where you wanna use it

212
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,639
And then you can just change that

213
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
Area that

214
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:25,247
Is passing the information to the layout because the layout

215
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,807
has not got access to this

216
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,623
And so you need to pass it through it

217
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:32,927
The values that you want to use in it

218
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:37,279
It will still look at how exactly that is done and possibly I will

219
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
explain it again but just script

220
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,703
Basically renders a layout

221
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,103
And this is also how component builder knows it should add a layout to the components layout folder

222
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,127
And

223
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:56,479
 it looks for a layout with that name in your layouts list

224
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,319
So you need to have these layouts set up before hand

225
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
Before you can include them

226
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Into other

227
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,927
Views and

228
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,975
Tablets

229
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,839
And do note that the layout concept and implementation

230
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:16,447
Together with the template is the same in the custom admin View

231
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,751
It works exactly the same

232
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:22,591
And just by adding the snippet to the default View

233
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:27,711
Component builder know it needs to add that layout to the component and knows at least

234
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,319
Add that layout template to that site View

235
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
Ok so that is adding

236
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,647
Site views

237
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,743
Sorry templates and layouts to a site View

238
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
And

239
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:44,351
Looking at the code seeing ok so

240
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
Component builder builds these site views because when

241
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,239
We look at the default View

242
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,775
They are actually

243
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,311
Loaded here you see

244
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
Preacherbox and there is preacherbox

245
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
This preacher panel

246
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:00,479
preacher panel

247
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:02,015
There is

248
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:03,807
Preacher small

249
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,623
And there is preacher small and there is

250
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:09,183
Table grid list there is

251
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,463
Table

252
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
grid and list

253
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:15,071
So that is how you can

254
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
Add your code into

255
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,399
Smaller chunks

256
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,239
And next up will look at setting up a template

257
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:23,519
And

258
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,847
Making use of this implementation

259
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Understanding the difference

260
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
So

261
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
That is adding templates and layouts to site views
