1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:04,352
I would like to demonstrate to you the new implementation

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:06,912
Which isn't such a major thing but

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,728
Something we've done to try and

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,312
Help along some of the router complexity

5
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,616
So when you build a component

6
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:17,408
And you have a front end

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,480
For your component so you've got site views

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:24,832
Your site views usually are getting it's data from a dynamic get

9
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
Which you link up to the site View

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
and this dynamic get basically returns a

11
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
Resultset

12
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:36,608
and it is from this result set

13
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,912
That we should get information

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
By which we

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,520
Combined with the view name

16
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
Build what is called a

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,896
Search engine friendly URL

18
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:53,248
 your search engine friendly URL is basically done with the router

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,064
So JCB also builds the router

20
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,136
And it sort of guesses what should be these values

21
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
So let me compile a component

22
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,488
And show you what it guessed

23
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:06,816
And then see how we would need to change it

24
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:11,424
the component that we're working with here is Sermon Distributer

25
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
So I'm gonna compile it

26
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,032
And install it to this website

27
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,408
as now the router doesn't really work I'm not gonna demonstrate

28
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
the

29
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,016
 actual front-end

30
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,064
I'm just gonna show you the code

31
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
And

32
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,392
And let's take it from there

33
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,536
So when you look at the website you've got your root directory admin

34
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,816
And then components

35
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:42,400
And then in here we've got Sermon Distributer

36
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,448
And there's a file called router

37
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
I'm gonna open this

38
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,568
And you'll see there's got a function called build

39
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
I'm a class method

40
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:55,200
As well as a function called parse

41
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
and in this function

42
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,016
called parse

43
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
There is a switch

44
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
Which basically

45
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,696
Makes decisions based on the segment's

46
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,232
First value

47
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,816
And if that segment's value is

48
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,376
Because usually that would be the view name

49
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:14,656
In this first

50
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Value

51
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,472
it determines 

52
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:20,288
which view are we looking at is it preacher

53
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
And so we going through the list

54
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,920
Now by Default without us

55
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:29,504
You know making any changes

56
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
JCB Builders for us

57
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
All of it

58
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
So

59
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
If we look at preachers

60
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Which is a

61
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,536
Basically a listview

62
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
Let's open the preacher model

63
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
So here is preachers

64
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,192
We can scroll down

65
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,240
And we'll see that

66
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
In its

67
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,544
Query

68
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,664
It basically has a get items and here it got a list query

69
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:02,272
And it really is just getting all the items from Database

70
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:05,344
With no input from the URL whatsoever

71
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:07,392
Let's see

72
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,464
Yeah it doesn't do any of that and then it just

73
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:11,744
Gives back

74
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,792
So it's a simple as that

75
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,840
It does not

76
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:18,400
Need a URL value

77
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,240
So that means it most probably will only

78
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,544
Set this verse

79
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:26,080
Value

80
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,176
And all of this will really be redundant, it won't be used

81
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,224
Because it's a listview

82
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
So there isn't an alias

83
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,624
We not looking at an individual item so there isn't an ID

84
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,672
So we could

85
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,976
Actually remove this here

86
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:43,744
This code

87
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,024
It's not doing anything

88
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
Now

89
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,608
It is also not gonna really

90
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,400
Slow your site down that

91
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,984
Dramatically it's fact it's it's hardly noticeable

92
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
It's it's just that this is default

93
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
Being generated

94
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,640
Where us if we look at for example

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,040
Preachers is the list view but then there is a view called preacher we see it here

96
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
And it is saying that

97
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,392
It needs to get the ID from

98
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
Discernment table

99
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Which is actually in error

100
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,047
So if I open the preacher

101
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
And I look at the list query

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:24,447
Then I see that in the list query about here

103
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,751
It is getting an ID

104
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
From the URL

105
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:32,895
And it is asking that it should be equal to preacher

106
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
So

107
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,503
It is the main table is

108
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
Is the Sermon table

109
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,903
But it's not looking for the Sermon ID

110
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,207
It is looking for the preacher

111
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:49,791
Value in the Sermon table and that's why

112
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:52,607
JCB be fell back onto the table name

113
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
And yet

114
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,447
It should actually go to the preacher

115
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
Table and

116
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
See weather

117
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:02,079
That preacher value is equal to this ID

118
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,639
So it is actually

119
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
Making an error

120
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
Now you wrote the code or you set up the get so you should understand the logic of what you see in the code here

121
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
If you do not

122
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Then

123
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,047
This is a feature with JCB has with you possibly won't be able to you know make use of

124
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
Like we've said many times

125
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,655
JCB is for those who know PHP

126
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,959
And can actually write their own components

127
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,495
Now

128
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:36,383
I know that this is an error because we want to actually get the value the ID

129
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,663
Of the preacher

130
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:38,943
Is the one we need to check

131
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:42,271
And it is is doing it wrong it should

132
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:45,343
This value here should be preacher not sermon

133
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,439
You can look at the getVar class here at the bottom

134
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
Here is the getVar class

135
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
And here you can see what it's going to do

136
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,607
And how it's going to actually get the values

137
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
So you can also use the getVar class

138
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,727
 for your own purposes

139
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:02,751
So

140
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,591
At this point we see at least one of the

141
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,383
Router case

142
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,687
Within the parse method

143
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:13,759
In the case loop there's at least one

144
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:16,319
 router area that needs to be changed

145
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:20,671
I know by having looked at this before

146
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:24,767
That there is actually more than one it's also this categories

147
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
Down here

148
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
This one

149
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Should also change

150
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,143
This should also become

151
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,471
Well actually it should just get a true

152
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Here

153
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,055
there should be true because this is a category

154
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Look up

155
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:41,663
Now the other place it also need to change is this one

156
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,711
There should also be serious

157
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:47,551
So this is where the guessing which JCB does

158
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,575
Dynamically

159
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,671
Did not match the complexity of our Dynamic get

160
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:57,535
And I'm sure that as time goes on we might

161
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Improve it's

162
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,679
Guessing Ok we might get better ways of guessing correctly

163
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:04,447
And

164
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,543
Within the dynamics of the dynamic get

165
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,431
Be able to actually build this case more effectively but

166
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:17,247
Since we have not done that yet

167
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,391
The quickest way for us to resolve this and which most probably be the most Dynamic option

168
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:28,255
Is actually adding a way that you can replace the snippet of code

169
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,559
Targeting the specific

170
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
View

171
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:35,423
So you will never need to really know what is the view

172
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,983
When you do this because they are placeholders

173
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
And you need only remember where you at your dynamic

174
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Get

175
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,431
So let me go and illustrate this within the JCB interface

176
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:53,087
So all I wanted to show you here is that we are actually targeting with this new Dynamic implementation

177
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
This little snippet

178
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,671
This area here

179
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,975
We not replacing the whole method

180
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:03,071
Because really it is it is standard there's not much to do in

181
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:07,423
Improving that and if we do it will be just improving it for everyone

182
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:12,799
And the built function it really works well I haven't seen any issues with that

183
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823
So

184
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,895
At the end of the day it seems like only the parse method

185
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,687
Needed a bit of an improvement

186
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,271
So let's go back to the interface and let me let me show you

187
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:24,575
Where we can make the changes

188
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,415
To have the the category render correctly

189
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
As well as the preacher

190
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,095
This one here as well as the series 

191
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
...........

192
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,399
............

193
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,471
Basically make the changes so that this will say

194
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
Series

195
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,055
And

196
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
That this one will say true

197
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,431
And this one

198
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
This preacher would also say

199
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Preacher

200
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,831
That's basically all we need to do and then this router

201
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Will work

202
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,391
Without any errors

203
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,671
Ok

204
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
So here in the interface you have site views

205
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:10,143
Now the site views the ones who wanna make changes to his this preacher

206
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:15,519
The series and the category now I'm gonna show this to you little bit

207
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,799
Long winded but

208
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
Bear with me

209
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
It's just make sure everybody is on the same page

210
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
If you open preacher

211
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,479
You would see that it has a dynamic

212
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Get called

213
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:29,343
Sermons preacher ID and it say get list query

214
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,391
Ok so

215
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
This is the one

216
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
We want to change

217
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,511
The get

218
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,791
the dynamic get

219
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
As well as speaking about serieses

220
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,655
The same is true of that

221
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:43,935
We have this

222
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:46,239
List query get series ID

223
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
Sermons that we also want to change

224
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,359
And so we not changing it in the view

225
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
The idea was

226
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:57,247
That if we change it in the dynamic get it automatically

227
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,111
Right to correct code to whatever view you add it because we've added some custom

228
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,647
Scripting

229
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
Sorry placeholders within the script

230
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:09,535
So let's take the first one is this sermon

231
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
Where is it

232
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:13,375
Sermon series

233
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:21,567
So in custom script we scroll down to the bottom there is now a new

234
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Tab here option here

235
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
Add PHP

236
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,991
Parse method in router little bit of explanation there

237
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,015
click yes

238
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,063
And it will Dynamically load

239
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:36,927
What is what I can consider the most basic implementation of that little snippet

240
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:40,511
So you see it looks very familiar it's got his place holders

241
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
And it has a specific

242
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,095
It has a specific

243
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,655
S View placeholder

244
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
That's because we're dealing with the site View

245
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
And it has to have this s in it

246
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:54,847
To replace it with the site view name

247
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,967
So wherever this is gonna be used this this Dynamic get

248
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
This

249
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
Would be replaced with that specific site view's  value

250
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,391
Ok that's just to give you a heads up

251
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,719
About the place holder and that's what makes it dynamic

252
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,071
So that you can use it in any site view and it will automatically write this

253
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:20,959
Because really the the display of the page is actually based on the database request 

254
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
Which is built in the URL by the name of the view

255
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,615
As well as the ID of the element

256
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:31,711
And if there are multiple variables being passed

257
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,759
To the

258
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
URL

259
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,879
You can obviously update that and

260
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
Replace multiple values

261
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:41,951
So

262
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
Here we want to within this one

263
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,119
Did the default option here will actually resolve our issue because

264
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,679
Remember these two values were not the same

265
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,287
JCB's Dynamic build actually changed this value to

266
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Sermon instead of

267
00:11:57,823 --> 00:11:58,591
Leaving it

268
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,359
The same

269
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,919
And there is a very good reason

270
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
For that

271
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:08,575
Usually this would be the correct response but in this case because of complexity I'm not gonna explain

272
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:12,671
It isn't the correct response and so you want these two values to be the same

273
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
And it is basically the site view's name

274
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,047
So we could just save it close this

275
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:22,399
The next one we wanna do is this sermon preacher

276
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,703
And it was also

277
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
Having the same issue basically

278
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
So we

279
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
We gonna do the the same kind of

280
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,431
Just add the the custom

281
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Option

282
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
To ensure that these two values remain the same

283
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,367
And then the last but not least was this category 

284
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,159
It is also behaving

285
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Incorrectly

286
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
And really it's only because it

287
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:48,767
Didn't detect

288
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
That this is actually category

289
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:55,935
And that is primarily because it is using the Sermon table

290
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
To to start instead

291
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,543
In the Sermon table

292
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,871
We have a joint here

293
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
too

294
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,199
 category

295
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
If you can see there

296
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,063
And so it does load the category and

297
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,087
 the tweak

298
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,159
You see that we are actually using

299
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,231
This ID

300
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
And this is a category ID

301
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,863
So it should actually go look for the category

302
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
And

303
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,959
build the parse method based on the category

304
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
And so

305
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
here

306
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,543
We also gonna Just Add

307
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,079
A true

308
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,359
To this getVar

309
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,407
Which tells the getVar

310
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,735
 method that this is actually a category

311
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
This this name

312
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
In effect is actually gonna be ignored

313
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:51,231
Because it's gonna not be looking for this tables value is gonna go to the category table

314
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:53,023
And look for the value there

315
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:56,607
Ok so this will resolve this this issue

316
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:59,167
We can save and close this one

317
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,959
So now we have

318
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,031
Done some customisation to our router

319
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,823
Just by adding those

320
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,871
Values to the dynamic get

321
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:10,431
If we compile our components now

322
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,247
It will automatically fall back

323
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Unto those

324
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:16,575
Values

325
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Just

326
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
install again

327
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
And now let's go look at the code

328
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,023
So we see here

329
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,375
That it did exactly what he wanted it added preacher preacher there

330
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
And this is now

331
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
Categories is true

332
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,239
And

333
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
We see the series is series

334
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,127
And so now at least we know that this actual

335
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
The router will behave correctly

336
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:48,575
This is the first step of our improvement to the router

337
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
It seems to me that we already have a very workable

338
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:57,791
Situation and this is really gonna make it too much better

339
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,887
There was also the idea of adding some custom scripting into the built

340
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Method

341
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
And we will look at that

342
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,519
And I invite

343
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
You and anyone else too

344
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,591
To get involved

345
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:14,943
On this on GitHub just if you know how to improve his even more

346
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Then please

347
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:19,807
I get in contact with me and let's let's work together

348
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
This is so what we've done so far

349
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:26,463
But like an all iterative developing concepts

350
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Will continue improving

351
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
 this

352
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,095
To the point where it really serves as well

353
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,935
And holds up with changes also happening in Joomla itself

354
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,239
Ok well thanks for watching
