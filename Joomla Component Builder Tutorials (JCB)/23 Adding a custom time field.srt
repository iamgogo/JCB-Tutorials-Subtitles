00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Hi

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:07,680
Ok I would like to quickly demonstrate how to set up a time

3
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:08,960
field

4
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,008
Now you know that

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,384
In programing obviously a time must always be linked to a date

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,992
Because time is stored as an integer

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,528
And

8
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:24,064
therefore

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:25,856
If you only want

10
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:30,208
A Field Where only a time is set let's say

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,536
5:15 or something

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:37,376
Then I would suggest to use a normal text field

13
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,680
And you

14
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
Create a regex

15
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:45,056
Method

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:51,712
This could be done via a

17
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,504
I just close this

18
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,648
This could be done via a

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,184
Custom form

20
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Filter

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
The way to setup a custom filter

22
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,608
let me use

23
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,424
This component

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,776
 you go to modules and then you would see rules

25
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
And in here you can create a rule

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,944
And then you would use that as the filter name

27
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,248
So you would

28
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,320
component Builder you would create a file

29
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:34,208
And you would place it in your custom folder

30
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,024
Any any name

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
Put it in here

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:41,632
So let me illustrate that let me

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,936
Well I'm gonna illustrate that

34
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:48,288
I'll just use one of these files to illustrate how to include it

35
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,872
But you would basically create a

36
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Rule

37
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:56,992
How to create to create a rule

38
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:01,088
I think let me see if I can get you some documentation on that quickly

39
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:06,208
I think the easiest would be to basically go to your

40
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,792
Scroll up here

41
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,584
go to

42
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
Your in component

43
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,680
You're in Joomla right

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:18,240
So you go to libraries Joomla

45
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,776
Then form

46
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
and then Rules

47
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,616
Can You can open any of these rules

48
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
And you can look

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
And what they've done

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,528
And you would follow the same convention

51
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,344
you basically extend

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,624
J form rule

53
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,952
You give it a unique name

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,256
Make sure it isn't one of these

55
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:42,304
Jform rule

56
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,328
And then

57
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,888
We are already component Builder

58
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,472
Already when it when it constructs the

59
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,776
The XML document

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
That is used

61
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,640
In your

62
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Construction of your form

63
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:08,928
Sermon Distibuter  modules

64
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,464
your Form

65
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,280
If I open any of them let say this one

66
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,120
it already includes the rule path

67
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,448
you see and that rule path is This rule

68
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:25,056
So if you are using a filter

69
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:30,944
So how you would apply it is this you would simply add the word filter

70
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,784
equals now in component builder there is actually a way

71
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,320
to add This

72
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
But basically

73
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:40,416
That would be the same name

74
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:41,952
As

75
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
That I suppose

76
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
that Tel

77
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,376
would be the filter name

78
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:51,680
Ok

79
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
And then in here you have your

80
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
Test which

81
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
Basically tests

82
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,336
Whether this is

83
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
Acceptable

84
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,968
And in here you could do regex and all kinds of nice

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,552
Means to to validate whether the input field

86
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,624
On the server side is actually acceptable

87
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,672
So this is a server side

88
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,232
Verification of the input

89
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,375
And so you'd see in component builder if I'm just go there

90
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:24,447
It's a new

91
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,823
And I would select text

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
Just a normal text field

93
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
You would see that it has here

94
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
Filter

95
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,831
As well as validate

96
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,415
Now I think the rule gets placed here in validate

97
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,695
That's right

98
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:51,839
Validate is where you place your rule name so your custom rule name might be time

99
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
for example

100
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,703
And then that would ensure

101
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,031
On the server side that only time was submitted

102
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,847
Now The Next Step to

103
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
Ensure that 

104
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
The user only types in

105
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,271
.

106
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,831
 numbers and a colon

107
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:15,135
Instead of anything else

108
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,231
would be able to do some JavaScript here in the

109
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
View footer

110
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,095
You could add JavaScript here that targets

111
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,399
This field

112
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,959
Via adding a

113
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:32,287
A class a unique class name here

114
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Or

115
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,615
Going to the form where the field

116
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,663
for example this is a field right

117
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
it use firebug

118
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
And you would select

119
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
That field

120
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
so in firebug you will see the ID

121
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,183
So with JavaScript

122
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,207
You can

123
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,767
 target the input of that ID

124
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,327
And if that

125
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:00,447
ID has input that is not what you would expect from time

126
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,983
Then you could

127
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:05,311
either scream at the user or shout or just

128
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,127
Emptied the box with a little note under it

129
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,503
But that would be a JavaScript implementation on top of your text

130
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:14,783
Field

131
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Now

132
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,391
That is maybe a long explanation

133
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:25,279
But that is how you do a field if only you want time

134
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,399
If you want time and you don't mind that there is a date in volved

135
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,703
I actually have

136
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:35,775
Build a field like that already

137
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
That I'm using

138
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,871
You see because in

139
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,479
In the repeatable Fields you can't use the calendar

140
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,503
Field

141
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:48,063
So I created a field

142
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
That's sort of

143
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,879
Allows me to still do that

144
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
  let me show you

145
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,999
There is a component I'm working on

146
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
registration component

147
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
So if we go events

148
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,167
Open an event

149
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:10,079
Then you would see that ok

150
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,383
Yeah I can set dates

151
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,431
But these dates

152
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
If I click in the box

153
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
You see it has it time

154
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,087
Adjuster

155
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:23,903
And I can select a date

156
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,463
And adjust the time and click done

157
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
And it updates the field

158
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,303
With that selection

159
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
If that is the kind of field

160
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:36,191
That you're looking for then implementation is quite different

161
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,263
I can I can do to show you that

162
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,967
Ok so I'll open it you can see it it the type is a text type

163
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:54,367
So basically I've just added it added it hint

164
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,695
It's just a normal text type you could pause the video

165
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,047
And you can look at the field XML

166
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:07,423
Now since I'm using this field in a repeatable

167
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:08,703
Field

168
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,775
the JavaScript

169
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,847
Is quite different right because you

170
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,735
You have a working with a repeatable field that you can add as many Fields as you like

171
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:25,087
But you want this date field to be active on everyone of those

172
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,159
And you can't really

173
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,439
Target

174
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
A repeatable field

175
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:36,095
Simply by adding some JavaScript in this area here

176
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:40,959
Unless you know that feels ID and so instead of doing it in here

177
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:46,079
I actually added to Javascript that is needed to make this field work

178
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:51,455
Into the repeatable fields structure so let me close this and show you that

179
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
Case I think it's event dates

180
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
So one of those

181
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,719
Values there is obviously the ID

182
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Of that date field that

183
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:08,351
I did I just showed you and so in scripts

184
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,191
Again here I can maybe zoom in a little

185
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,127
You can you can pause the video

186
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,687
and exactly look what I did there

187
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,271
Basically including

188
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,855
Some Styles as well as some JavaScript

189
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,439
And then I have a loop

190
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,743
Which Loops 50 times

191
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,607
Because I'm only allowing ,if you are looking at the repeatable field

192
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
I'm only allowing 50

193
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:44,703
Fields to be added

194
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,263
So I only need to loop 50 times

195
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,543
And then

196
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:52,383
In the loop I'm actually targeting through the dynamic

197
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
PHP

198
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,479
I'm targeting each of those fields

199
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:02,367
At the moment there's a row added I'm checking whether that row exists if it does

200
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,415
I'm simply using the jQuery

201
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
Date

202
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,999
Time picker which is actually

203
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,071
Brought to The Page by this

204
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
The Script here

205
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:17,471
And then it has some options which is tweakable

206
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,263
And that's it

207
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,543
That's how I add

208
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
That kind of date selecting

209
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:24,127
picker method

210
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,919
In a repeatable field

211
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:30,015
Again I will hold it a bit there you could pause the video

212
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:32,575
jottle that down if you want

213
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,623
and Scroll down again

214
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,695
This is this is actually the end of the code

215
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
that is the start

216
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:43,583
Ok that's all that it takes

217
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,119
To to add

218
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,519
 O, yes another thing because I have multiple data Fields so if you open that again

219
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
You see that

220
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,383
here I have a start and an ending date

221
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
And here in cost adjustment

222
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:02,527
I also have

223
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,807
A

224
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,343
Target date

225
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,927
And so if you look at my script

226
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,535
You'd see that I have a field type array

227
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,375
Which basically is used to Target

228
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,495
those different fields in there different pop-ups 

229
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
So

230
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
You would if you only targeting one field

231
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
You wouldn't need this extra iterating

232
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Method or

233
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
Variable which I'm using here

234
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:38,111
Instead of having to retype it for every field I just added 

235
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
A loop

236
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:43,999
In the PHP it's just code Ok that's

237
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,791
I think that should do it

238
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:49,119
About further documentation

239
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:53,215
I realized that that might be necessary

240
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
And

241
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,567
Honestly I just don't have time at the moment

242
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,663
Because their component isn't earning me

243
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
A great deal of income

244
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,783
Besides the fact that I myself

245
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,879
I'm using it and developing components and I have developed quite

246
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
 a lot already

247
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,071
I realize that that might be a community project

248
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:21,375
And something I would

249
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
Actually encourage

250
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:23,679
So

251
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,543
Everywhere in component builder in any of it's list view

252
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
We have an help menu

253
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,383
Already

254
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
Which actually opens up

255
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
A

256
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Website

257
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,575
Which has a wiki

258
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
Option

259
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
it's Actually a redmine website

260
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
Here is the URL you could see it

261
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:53,119
And if if anyone wants to get involved in in the community

262
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,423
We help improve the documentation

263
00:12:55,935 --> 00:13:02,079
per list view as well as per function as you can see I've already done quite a bit in writing

264
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:05,407
Documentation for every list View

265
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
Explaining these buttons

266
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
And

267
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:17,695
Even So on so this help button here you could add your own Help by going to the help

268
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,975
Documentation

269
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:24,351
And here is the list of the already set up help

270
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:26,143
If you open one of these

271
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:30,239
You would see that here is the URL that we're using

272
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,519
And

273
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Obviously

274
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:36,639
As we develop this component further

275
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:41,503
We would eventually add more help documentation right in the component

276
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,599
But it will in actual fact map to this

277
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:47,647
This website

278
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:53,535
Because that way or everybody can benefit from any improvements

279
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
So the website URL

280
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,375
For those of you

281
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,911
Might wanna go there

282
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
It's  projects. VDM

283
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,799
Again projects and

284
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,103
Joomla component Builder

285
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:07,871
Wiki

286
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,431
And yes you could I

287
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:13,759
Suppose just go there and from there navigate

288
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,367
If you want to get involved in editing the

289
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
The tutorial or the documentation

290
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,999
And you say to me, OK Llewellyn

291
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,303
I would help you setup

292
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Documentation

293
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:32,191
Give me a greater discount on accessing the tutorials

294
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,727
We could strike a deal

295
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,335
Because to me I really I have a time

296
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,359
Constrained

297
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:42,431
and so at this point

298
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,223
As a community project

299
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
I hope you understand

300
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,551
Thanks so much
