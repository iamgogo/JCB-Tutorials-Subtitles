00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Hi

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:03,584
I wanna demonstrate to you

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,400
How to add a button

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:09,472
To your components admin View

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,776
Either in the list area

6
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,592
Or in the edit area of the

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,360
View

8
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:18,432
Now I possibly have touched on this

9
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,064
In previous tutorials but I thought Well let's make one tutorial it just deals with that

10
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,624
Ok so I have a

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,232
Blank install of JCB here I just got this demo component

12
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,024
Installed

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,656
Or mapped and I've been installed it into this website

14
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:42,496
So if I go to Looks it just looks as it should

15
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,288
and we can create an item

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,336
And the

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,688
Just the

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:55,296
Give it some details

19
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,136
Say

20
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Now we click save and close and we have an item now you see there's

21
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,800
a whole bunch of buttons here and if you go into the test

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,104
There's also a bunch of buttons here

23
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,712
All of them are usually there those are the default buttons

24
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,552
So what do you wanna do if you want to

25
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,928
Actually create buttons in these areas without custom coding

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:38,048
You can of course do it with custom coding but there is a JCB way to do it

27
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,096
You know in JCB

28
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
quite easily

29
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:44,448
So let's go back to our

30
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,728
Admin views

31
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,360
And then we open the admin view called look

32
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:02,368
And you'll see there's a custom buttons area here I click on that

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,928
We say yes you wanna add custom button

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,256
They would see that it opens control methods

35
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:13,120
And also list view controller methods

36
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,424
Now that will

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Obviously

38
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
You need to understand the MVC

39
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:23,872
Your controller your model again your controller and your model

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:27,200
Each view has two controllers two models

41
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Because it has a listview

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,552
And it has a edit View

43
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,136
The list view has its own controller and model

44
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,280
And the edit view has his own controller and model so depending on where you placing the button

45
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
It will affect

46
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
Which model and which controller

47
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
You need to use

48
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:52,032
I'm not gonna explain much about the PHP being placed in these blocks

49
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
Because

50
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,128
That should be something you know how to do

51
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,200
If you don't you need to learn you need to study

52
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,272
to work with Joomla API

53
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:07,392
I'd not able to also you know educate you on that now at this stage

54
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
So you do a custom button you'd click on adding a button here's your icon you can

55
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Select any of the icons these are the default Joomla icons that they use also called

56
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,216
Icon

57
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,264
Icomoon or something

58
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,056
So you can use that

59
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,848
Then the name of the button

60
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
What you wanna call it so I'm just gonna call it a test for now then the

61
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
Name of the controller method

62
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,624
So I'm gonna just call that get

63
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:42,464
Tested and

64
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Then

65
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:48,864
We'll decide is this gonna be an edit view a Single View Target

66
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
A list view or both

67
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,984
You know where Where must this button show up

68
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
So I'm gonna do

69
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,080
Just one for

70
00:03:58,336 --> 00:03:59,360
First list

71
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
And then

72
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,176
If it's a listview

73
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,224
See that says list Target

74
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,504
Then

75
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,576
We could decide whether this is only a function

76
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
Now when it is a selection

77
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:14,208
It means that you need to select some items

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,256
And then click the button

79
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,607
For it to actually submit those ids of the selected items

80
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,471
If it is a only a function you don't need to select anything

81
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,775
When you click the button a function

82
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,823
Will obviously be triggered

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:34,431
Which doesn't require you to give it any information

84
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
So it's basically just gonna

85
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,271
Do something

86
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:40,063
And that obviously

87
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
You need to be able to code that

88
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
Ok so I'm just gonna

89
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:45,951
Use the default

90
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
The default is actually

91
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:54,143
Very much like selection but it

92
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,959
behave differently if you

93
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:02,079
Yeah I think the best way to do this is select one of the options

94
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:05,151
Compile the component and go look at the code

95
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,455
And I'll show you where the code ends up

96
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
And then you can decide what you wanna do

97
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:12,319
Ok so I'm gonna just save this

98
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,391
As a selection in a listview and

99
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,159
Save

100
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:17,439
Ok

101
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:23,071
At this stage if we do not add

102
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
Values to these blocks for some reason it will scream at us so we just had to

103
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:33,055
Ford slashes

104
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:34,591
Which basically

105
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,895
Satisfies it's

106
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,199
Requirement of having information

107
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:44,063
I'm gonna add a little method here that simply gonna redirect us

108
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:46,111
To the dashboard

109
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:48,159
And I'm I'm gonna call it

110
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:49,439
Get tested

111
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,559
That that is simply a

112
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,887
A controller method it must be public

113
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
Here we simply checking whether it was submitted from the current website and

114
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,335
Then we just gonna redirect

115
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
To the components dashboard

116
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,431
here

117
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,271
We not gonna need a method now because we just redirecting

118
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:15,807
But if you

119
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,391
I will show you that in a minute let me just do this for now

120
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
And then let's save and close

121
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
And let's go compile this component

122
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,863
So we will just select

123
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,935
The demo component compile it

124
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:34,239
And then re-install it

125
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
To see the changes

126
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:42,687
We gonna go to the component

127
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,063
And then to Looks and now we will see there is a new button called test

128
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,367
And if we click it

129
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:52,927
It's empty redirect us to the dashboard

130
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,511
So that's all it does just redirects us

131
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,583
And you can then obviously redirect to anything

132
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,215
So that's just a first way of implementing a button in the listview

133
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:12,127
Now let us go back to to editing that the functionality there for the showing you some more

134
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:14,431
Options

135
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,503
So just open this again

136
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Go to custom buttons

137
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
Now maybe just add another button

138
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
We call it single

139
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,863
And we again call it something like a

140
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,751
And

141
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:42,335
The controller method

142
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:49,503
And will leave this to default and then

143
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,039
Save

144
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:57,695
So now in the controller method we said we gonna have a function called get done and

145
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,767
So here will just put a

146
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:07,167
Public function

147
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,591
So this time we will actually get the model and then

148
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:20,991
Do something with it in the model we can also get the

149
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:22,783
Item values

150
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:29,439
Since the moment you click this button you're inside of the item and it automatically submit the

151
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
Form

152
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
So we can actually grab those items values obviously it could be different values

153
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:39,935
from what's in the database just keep that in mind because

154
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:46,335
You could change the values then click that button and it will actually submit these new changed values

155
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,663
And yet those values have not been saved

156
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,687
To the database

157
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
And so if you want those values to actually now be in the database you'll need to actually

158
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:57,855
Put it there

159
00:08:58,367 --> 00:08:59,647
And

160
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:06,047
That's again I'm not gonna demonstrate how to do that but the model has a save method

161
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:08,607
And you should actually just

162
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,191
Do the necessary sanitation and then

163
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,983
Trigger the save message

164
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:17,055
The save method and it should store the data

165
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,151
So for our purposes I'm just gonna grab the data and

166
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:27,295
Not go through all that I'm just gonna do a little you know verification maybe and

167
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:32,927
And then return back either an error or or success so

168
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
First we going get the values

169
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,583
So now that we have the data we can check

170
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,679
Whether the values that we want to use is actually

171
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:50,079
There and available so let's say we wanna make sure that this is already a saved

172
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
Item

173
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:55,199
Then we at least check whether the ID is more than 0

174
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,271
We need to have a name and

175
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,807
Then we can check for that

176
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,647
And so we can do some checking within the controller

177
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,207
Before we trigger the model

178
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,559
And you know run the function we intend

179
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:17,215
Then we triggered the model we decide what we wanna call a method in the model so I just chose

180
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:23,615
Something random and then we can just create that method in the model area

181
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,967
And then do whatever we wanna do

182
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:32,319
So we

183
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Start doing some Logic in the model

184
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
Set out of above method however

185
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,487
Controller

186
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,535
Now we busy with the model area

187
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:42,815
Now

188
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,607
Do keep in mind that

189
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,935
If the model is unsuccessful you wanna do something

190
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,983
It's a data set

191
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:53,823
But the model is not being successful

192
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,359
You wanna do something

193
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,431
And if you data isn't said we also wanna do something

194
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,575
So those are the areas where in which can we can add some messages that we wanna give back to the user

195
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,111
Tell them what's happening

196
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
And so

197
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:14,303
In the model we basically just gonna perform our task and when they we have achieved our goal we give back

198
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:19,423
True whether we have failed we give back false and then that would

199
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
Trigger on messages in the controller

200
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
So this is just

201
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:29,407
Giving a basic overview of setting up some model controller connected with a button

202
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:36,831
So I'm gonna add some of this code in here you are welcome to pause the movie and then drop down whatever

203
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:43,231
You'd like to reuse but the reality is

204
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:46,303
You should actually be able to do this without my help

205
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
And therefore if you don't know what I'm doing here then please go Google a little more

206
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
Go find out some more tutorials elsewhere

207
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,335
How to create model

208
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,895
And controller relationships

209
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
In Joomla

210
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,223
Using it's API

211
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:09,343
The other reality is you can obviously open this model and controller

212
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
Of the specific View

213
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:18,047
In your IDE and in there you can see whether you know how the code is actually added

214
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,607
In what is happening in how is it done

215
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
And you can educate yourself

216
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
That way  as well

217
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
Ok I'm just gonna add to code in then

218
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:33,407
Ok so here I've just added some code that you can also reuse

219
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
And this basically if the work has been done will let the user know it's done

220
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,671
If work wasn't done we also let him know

221
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
If we couldn't even detect

222
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:50,815
The required values then we just throw a major error and

223
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Just quit out

224
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
So

225
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
That is really

226
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
The

227
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:00,799
The controller I didn't populate much of the model because

228
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:06,431
 you should design your own logic but I do return true so to

229
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,223
Give this first message

230
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:12,831
Then we'll go to the IDE change it to Falls again to demonstrate

231
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,367
You know the response

232
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,439
And just play around with the code in the IDE

233
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,047
To give you a sort of a feel of how to approach it from that

234
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,631
Direction ok so we gonna just save this

235
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:32,031
Then go and compile that again

236
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,151
Backup

237
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
Just compile it

238
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
And then

239
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,927
Install the new compiled version

240
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,719
And open the component

241
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:54,559
Go to Looks

242
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:01,215
So we can see how our test button still here if we click it still takes us to the dashboard

243
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
Now let's open the test

244
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,103
Now we have a new button here Worked

245
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:10,943
If you click it now it'll basically give us

246
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,783
The work was done because our method returns true

247
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,599
Now let me open the IDE

248
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,903
Ok looking at our

249
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Controller

250
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,511
We see that

251
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
Down here

252
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Somewhere

253
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:34,239
This is the front end I should go to the back end

254
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
Ok there it is

255
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
Controller

256
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:46,271
First we gonna open the list one which is the plural

257
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Version

258
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
And

259
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
here we see get tested was added

260
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,975
And there is a little method

261
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Then if we go to the

262
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,839
Edit singular one

263
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
Then getdone here is our method

264
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
And all our functions

265
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:06,751
And

266
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
JCB  has

267
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:12,127
Added The Script to the translation text

268
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
so everything here looks fine

269
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
If you now go to the model

270
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,503
And we open

271
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,807
The the look model

272
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
We'll see that

273
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:25,183
It has a new method added here somewhere

274
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,463
Scroll down till we see it

275
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,119
Sorry it was way up here I scrolled to

276
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Fast

277
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
And so I missed it

278
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:37,471
So just here after get table

279
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
Here it added our little method

280
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,311
So now

281
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Add this to false

282
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,431
And save

283
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,991
Go back to Joomla

284
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,087
And then click our

285
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,367
Button again

286
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,927
And now it says work was not done

287
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,255
Because the method returned false

288
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,559
So if we

289
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,375
Change that to True again

290
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,495
And save then it should work

291
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
Now let's test out another one

292
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,359
Let's also make this

293
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
you know

294
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Not execute

295
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:22,015
Save this so we can get this error

296
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
Go back to Joomla

297
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Click a button

298
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:30,975
And now it even kicks us out of the item

299
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,279
And it says a major error has occurred

300
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,071
The reason why it kicked us

301
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,631
Completely out of the item didn't check it in

302
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,679
Which is actually not ideal but

303
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,959
You could fix that

304
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
By looking at some of the other

305
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Controllers

306
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
And seeing what they do

307
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
When they want to kick you out

308
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,223
You know educate yourself by

309
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
Looking at some of how Joomla implements

310
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Some of these features

311
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,159
Now

312
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:00,927
Ok so

313
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
We

314
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,351
Basically got what we expected we are going to change this back safe

315
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
Go back to the view

316
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Open that you again

317
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
Click

318
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
our button

319
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,847
And now we get all is done and good

320
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,127
Ok so

321
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,967
That is a quick demonstration of adding a list button

322
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:27,551
As well as adding a button inside of the edit View

323
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Like I said you could

324
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,207
Actually add one button both as a list and inside

325
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:37,023
If you were to go to

326
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,303
That specific

327
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:42,911
Button

328
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,727
let's demonstrate that quickly

329
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,055
And we can open it and

330
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:55,455
Then instead of saying list here we say both and we click

331
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
 Save

332
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
Now

333
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
We'll obviously have to

334
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Add

335
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
This method

336
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,671
Get tested

337
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
Also to the

338
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
Single View like that

339
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,839
And then

340
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Save

341
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
And

342
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
then

343
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,103
Close out of this

344
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,711
Compile

345
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
But they keep on clicking that

346
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Backup

347
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
So used to doing that

348
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:43,071
And won't work now because I haven't set up to correct paths

349
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,607
Ok

350
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,143
Install it

351
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,215
Now let's first go look at the code

352
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:56,639
now to help you see where the button is being added I mean I shown you the controller I showed you 

353
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
 the model

354
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:04,319
But if you go to the view and you open look and you open this

355
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,391
 view HTML. PHP

356
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,463
And you open you go to add toolbar

357
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
You'll see that here

358
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,815
It actually

359
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Has added a custom

360
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
Button

361
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Get done and get tested

362
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:22,239
To the view

363
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
And

364
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,055
It is

365
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:28,127
Basically that is the method

366
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:30,175
That is gonna be called

367
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,807
By this specific button so it's gonna look in

368
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,135
In the look controller

369
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:39,903
And get

370
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,183
This method

371
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,975
That's really how it works

372
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:46,815
It also adds a switch a permissional switch

373
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:51,679
To the button if this specific user doesn't have the right to do the work

374
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Button

375
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
Then it won't show the button

376
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
And it will also

377
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
If you

378
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,919
 carry those permission structures through to your controller

379
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
It'll stop it even from being executed

380
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,247
You know

381
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,039
Manually via URL

382
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:13,951
But this that kind of security and implementation you'll need to know how to do that

383
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,023
Look at Joomla way of implementing it

384
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:21,631
 because you need to in the controller check whether this user has the permission

385
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:28,287
And so you need to know how to check that permission as well ok so

386
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,127
That's your showing you how the button gets added into the view

387
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,967
And where that code is and you can go look at it

388
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:39,295
Now I'm going back to to Joomla

389
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,111
And basically opening our component

390
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,975
And we go to Looks we still have our tested here

391
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,327
But now if we open the edit we will see have a got tested here as well

392
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,607
And if we click it

393
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,167
It will also just take us to the dashboard

394
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,239
And perform the same function as it would have

395
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
If we click

396
00:20:59,263 --> 00:20:59,775
There

397
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,431
Oh so that is just showing you that you can add one button to both the listview as well

398
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,015
The edit view of the backend admin area

399
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,087
I hope this will be useful

400
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
And thank you for watching
