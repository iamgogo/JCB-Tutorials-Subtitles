00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:02,560
Hi

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,376
We still working with

3
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,656
Sermon distributor

4
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,704
So I'm gonna use this preacher

5
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:10,496
Which is a

6
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:12,544
Get that I already have set up here

7
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,568
I'll use that

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
In our illustration

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:21,504
So here we can see that I have

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
This

11
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
Back end

12
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,112
View selected

13
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:27,136
So

14
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
It's been select nothing

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,976
This is usually how it will look

16
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
When you start

17
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:33,536
So

18
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,560
You'd look

19
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,328
Select

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,352
This

21
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,912
Depending on which

22
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,936
Area of the

23
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,496
Backend you wanna get the data from

24
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
You'd select

25
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
Backend View

26
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
Which is the

27
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,384
Best way to do it I would say

28
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,688
Then there is the Joomla Database

29
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
option

30
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
Would basically gives you the access to draw data from any other component installed that moment in the Joomla

31
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:01,184
Website

32
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
So if you select your Joomla Database

33
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:06,048
You can select any Database

34
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:07,328
That

35
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,376
Is actually at that stage

36
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
On your

37
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Database

38
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,960
Installed

39
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:17,056
And that means you can reach out to other components

40
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,080
Through this dynamic get

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,896
I'm gonna not do that

42
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:25,248
In fact that's also an area which I haven't tested so well

43
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
I

44
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,832
You possibly might try to implement that

45
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
And ran into some bugs

46
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,696
And this stage I can't make any apologies for that since

47
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,280
Really thing you should do is instead using

48
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,304
Back end

49
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,072
View

50
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
Option

51
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:41,888
Now

52
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
You might say but why is the other option there

53
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,800
Well it's because that's a feature we certainly want in the application right

54
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:51,360
And so I'm busy working in that direction

55
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,640
And busy

56
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:56,224
Programming so did that feature will work without any problems

57
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:00,064
In fact for the most part if you don't do very complex

58
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:01,856
Mapping

59
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,648
If you just do a simple

60
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,952
Direct database fetch like that

61
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,024
Are you be able to use this it won't give you an issue

62
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,096
What it really is about these other

63
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Linked

64
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
or Joint database structures

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,216
That really would make it complex

66
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
So

67
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
And that might

68
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
Cause problems

69
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,360
I'm not 100% sure

70
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
Obviously it did work

71
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:31,296
But I haven't tested it well enough as well as I have tested the other part and that is this back-end view

72
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,856
There is also the custom option

73
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
Where you can just dump the whole

74
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Option of

75
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
Using component builder to sort of write your

76
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Your your

77
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
PHP for you

78
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,680
And here you can add custom PHP

79
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,704
it will add

80
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,752
The methods data for you

81
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,360
So this is a custom get option where you write the code

82
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,896
Basically by hand

83
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
Where is this option

84
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,248
Write the code for you

85
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
So

86
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:05,088
You select the back-end view that you want to use

87
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,880
again that back-end view

88
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:11,744
Will be the the view that you connected to your component right

89
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,328
So you need to type that you name in here and then select

90
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,120
That package

91
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,680
And it will load

92
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,240
All the field names

93
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:29,152
As a.id and a.asset id and a.name and allias and icon

94
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,736
So these are all the fields inside of this view

95
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:35,808
And I will load it and I'll put this as

96
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Asset ID

97
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,672
Now again I would suggest you don't change that

98
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:42,720
What you can do is you can take

99
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Out

100
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,256
a row

101
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
You feel ok I don't need that row

102
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,168
Then you can

103
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,448
Remove a row

104
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Like that

105
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,032
And you can say I don't need the row

106
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,568
I don't need these

107
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
Way to there

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,688
Basically that's all the data you might want

109
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
And then you will know

110
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,576
That this would be the variable name

111
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,904
Of the data on When do When these get is used

112
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,232
So that's the

113
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:18,559
The basic part of setting up a Get

114
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:24,959
I need to mention that you have get types as well now the get types have 4 of them

115
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,031
There is the get item

116
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:33,407
Which will get one item so that means from this preacher table

117
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,943
It will get one item

118
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
Then you got the get listQuery

119
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,039
Which will get

120
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Multiple

121
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:40,831
Items

122
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:47,743
Ok so depending on how many items you want to get from the database you would select either get item or get list

123
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,559
Then you get custom

124
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
And then you got

125
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,887
Get customs that

126
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,655
plural

127
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
And

128
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
The difference between these two

129
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,007
or four

130
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Is the get item

131
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,871
Is what you will use only once per

132
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Per view

133
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,735
So if you are building a custom admin view

134
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:12,063
You will select a main get

135
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,647
Either of a get item or either of get list

136
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,231
But you can add multiple custom get item

137
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
Or custom get items

138
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,303
So

139
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,095
You can see these as

140
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:24,863
Other

141
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
Methods that you're adding to the page but it's not the main method

142
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:34,335
so you have main methods which are these a get item and get listquery

143
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,431
Which by the way is the exact naming of the methods that will be used

144
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:43,295
And then you got this custom get custom and get customs

145
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Which is really

146
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
almost same as these two it's just that they are not Main

147
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:51,231
There will only be another method in the

148
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
model

149
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
Which will bring data to the view

150
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
So you can add as many custom

151
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,935
Get custom and get customs

152
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Methods

153
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:05,823
To your view as you like but you could only add one get item and you only add

154
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
one get listquery

155
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Usually the way we would

156
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
decide on this

157
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:13,247
is that we would

158
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:17,343
Say what is the main objective of The View

159
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,951
What is the main dataset that we want to use in the view

160
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,791
And that is what we will use the get list query and get item for

161
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:26,559
Respectively

162
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,119
So if the main purpose of The View

163
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:32,191
It's a show preachers, a list of preachers

164
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,519
I would use the get list query as the main

165
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,567
Selection here

166
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:43,199
Now you see that you have when you do a list query you have the option of adding pagination

167
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
So

168
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,111
Basically that would mean whether the data should only return a certain number

169
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:53,183
Now Joomla has a global number there

170
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,791
Which you set in the system administrative area

171
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
under your Global settings

172
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,631
let me show you that

173
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,215
So you go to system

174
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:05,983
Then

175
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,519
Global configuration

176
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,615
And then you see there is a default list limit

177
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
This one here

178
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
And

179
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,247
That is what will be used as the amount

180
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,831
That limits the data being returned to the page

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,415
so it will only return at this stage 20 item

182
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,231
If I set that

183
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
pagination to yes

184
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,655
And if I set it to no it will load all the data

185
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
So yes would just load some of it

186
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,359
And no will load all of the data so depends on what you wanna do if you wanna do an Ajax

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,783
Well you wanna be sure that all the data is being loaded every time and you rather use JavaScript

188
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
Set up pagination for yourself for your view

189
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
Then that is why you would use

190
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
the no switch most of the time you're just say yes

191
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
And

192
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Joomla world

193
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:06,655
Sorry component builder will automatically add the pagination code to the page

194
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,727
It will also automatically add pagination

195
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,263
code to the model

196
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:14,847
And at the bottom of the page it will show a

197
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,431
one two three pagination now possibly depending on

198
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:20,223
The template you are using

199
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
And the styles that are on the page

200
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,599
Bootstrap is not on the page that

201
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:31,231
one two three might possibly not look right and you will need to add styling to it

202
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,791
component Builder doesn't

203
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
know what style is on your page so they cannot make provision for all of that

204
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,471
But it actually can load the pagination itself

205
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
And it does

206
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Do that

207
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
Ok

208
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:47,359
Now here you have data and

209
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,199
You can join this data to other database tables

210
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,295
And now again here like with the main source

211
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:57,343
You're able to select

212
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,391
Joint Views From a table

213
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:04,255
A view Table which is basically the views of the component

214
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:06,303
Or just any database table

215
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,375
And to one of the database tables I often

216
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
Connect to these categories

217
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,751
you see because component builder

218
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
Integrates

219
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
It's application

220
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
If you add a category field

221
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,687
To any View

222
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:27,039
It dynamically set up a category for your component

223
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:33,695
And integrates the category concept into your component so it writes all that code for you and basically the way

224
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:35,743
that Joomla's own

225
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
Applications like

226
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:41,119
Article manager does it so it's using the same conventions

227
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:47,263
So if you know how Joomla article manager is bringing categories into the articles

228
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
Then that is the way your component is gonna do it as well

229
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
And

230
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
Here

231
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,431
You can now select categories

232
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:56,223
You can say

233
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
These switches I'll

234
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
Deal with

235
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
When we come and look

236
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,623
in More detail at this area

237
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
And then you can model the data there

238
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,303
And model I mean decide what you want to return you don't want to return everything from categories

239
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,703
But the one I want to look at first is actually this joint view Table we'll come back to the DB option

240
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,359
The joint view Table let you again select from any of the other views that is

241
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,895
Part of your component

242
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:28,479
And again you can select whether it should return a single row

243
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Or a

244
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,295
List of rows

245
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:35,647
Now when you say single row it means it's gonna literally join it

246
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,999
To this other data set that you have as your main data or your main source

247
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,071
It will just be another

248
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
Item in the array

249
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,191
And so that's why you can't use the name

250
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,215
Name

251
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
For example here

252
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,543
It needs to have that

253
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
That series underscore in front of it

254
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:02,271
So that it doesn't clash with the other data set that possibly also has a value called name

255
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:07,391
So again here if you selected

256
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,927
you know let me just select

257
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Anything here

258
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,231
Series

259
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,375
You see that it will populate this area with all the fields that is in that View

260
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,423
Then this as

261
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,447
Button here

262
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Basically

263
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,287
You can't use the same

264
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Alphabetic number

265
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
twice in the whole

266
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:30,175
In the whole query

267
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
So

268
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:36,831
So the whole get function can only use a once and then b once and then c once

269
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
and then D

270
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,367
So

271
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:40,159
You need to make sure that the

272
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
That these are set up that you can

273
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:45,279
we'd made provision up to z z

274
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,583
How many tables you can

275
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
have

276
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,655
Only in this area here

277
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
and So

278
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
Basically you would

279
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,031
First decide whether this row

280
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,335
Type what type of return it will be

281
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,687
If you set it to multiple you see that these names automatically update

282
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
Because now

283
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,039
The way that the get method will

284
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Work

285
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,855
Is it will create a new

286
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
Method

287
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,671
Which will get this data

288
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,975
And add it into your item list

289
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,535
Via this relationship so

290
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,583
I'm adding the on field

291
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:24,191
as the Dot a series that's where the ID is for the series

292
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,799
And the joint field I'm using the C ID which is that one

293
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
So that means in the main Database

294
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,407
That is the a database

295
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,223
There must be a field called series

296
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,039
And it has the ID of the series

297
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,623
And it corresponds to the ID in this list

298
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,207
And if I wanted to return a multiple it means that

299
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,279
The main database which is in that case a sermon

300
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
Can be linked to multiple serieses

301
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
But in the system we are working with here

302
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
That is not possible you can only

303
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,519
Connect a sermon

304
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
to one series

305
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,871
So that means it's certainly a single return

306
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,431
Then it will immediately add this

307
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,991
Series underscore in front of everything

308
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,807
to insure doesn't clash with your a table

309
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:13,343
That's What It's basically doing

310
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,415
Again you can remove the fields you don't want but

311
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Please do not edit

312
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
The string

313
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
It possibly would make it break

314
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:26,143
I wanted to be possible that you can change this name to anything you like

315
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,543
And we are gonna try and do that eventually but for now it's still doesn't really like you doing that

316
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,639
And it it in fact you can be changing it it will still

317
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,199
write it this way in the code that's

318
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:45,855
That's part of why I'm saying you shouldn't change it not because it will break something but because it will be ignored and you might

319
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,671
expect something else than what it is actually doing

320
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
So it still is gonna use this

321
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
Implementation even if you change it

322
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:59,423
But it will drop the fields you don't select so if you say I don't want these

323
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:06,335
That

324
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,687
Then it won't get those Fields and you will only have this data returned

325
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,735
And

326
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,039
again here you can have equal

327
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,319
Not equal

328
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,343
Equal or not

329
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
And

330
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,927
we also have in function

331
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
That means

332
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,255
if This joint value

333
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
Sorry

334
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,327
If this on field

335
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Is an array

336
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,911
Then you can use the in function

337
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,959
To make sure that it

338
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:36,543
Actually looks whether the id in this

339
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:38,335
That's the in function

340
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,639
And again

341
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,247
Remember when we started out I told you that you need to be willing to get your hands dirty

342
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,271
Now

343
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,551
This code

344
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,111
If we go to the component itself

345
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,415
I'll show you where it writes this code

346
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,463
So

347
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
Let me scroll down to the bottom here

348
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:59,071
And let's see we're looking into sermon

349
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,095
Preacher ID

350
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,423
Now we'll still get to why it says preacher ID

351
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:06,239
When we look at the filters and the where

352
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
but let us go to the code

353
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
Now you can actually see

354
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
I'm gonna refresh this page and then go to the code

355
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:17,759
Ok so since this get is used in the front

356
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:21,599
Of the component we will go to the front end and not to the admin area

357
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,647
So we go to the front end

358
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,183
Of sermon distributor

359
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,719
And then we are

360
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,535
Looking at the model right the get

361
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
Dynamic get is used in the model to get the data

362
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,423
And we are looking at sermons

363
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:36,959
let me just make sure of that

364
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,519
Yes it's sermons

365
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,335
Getting a list query and it's using pagination

366
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Getting all this

367
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
So

368
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,175
we're Looking at sermons

369
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,575
Sermons on the

370
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
Under the preacher ID so it should be this model

371
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:01,279
I'll still show you the way that I know all that

372
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,607
But just that I could get you into the code

373
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
here You can see

374
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
the main

375
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Method

376
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:13,055
Which actually has this dot ID

377
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
or the main

378
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
Data set sorry not method

379
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:18,943
data set

380
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:20,479
It is written here

381
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,367
So here you can see ID, acid ID name alias link types short description

382
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:27,903
If you look at the

383
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
UI it says the same things, alias, link type short description

384
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:34,303
Icon preacher series category ID

385
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
So this is where it writes it

386
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
And it shows you where in the complier it's done that

387
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703


388
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,287
Then it sets up the Second one Series you see

389
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,335
And

390
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
Then

391
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,919
You can also see it says series

392
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Equals

393
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
c ID

394
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,759
So series

395
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
There is series

396
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Equals

397
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
The c

398
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
This table series

399
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
ID

400
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:10,143
And then it also tells you what it wants from c it wants the name and the alias and then it wants a series name

401
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
that Changes it to series

402
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,495
Since this is in the select

403
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,287
Query this is one

404
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:19,359
function there

405
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:20,895
And

406
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
So that array

407
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
And

408
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:26,015
Transposes to this array

409
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,111
That is the way that you make use of Joomla's

410
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,671
Database PPI

411
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,975
So it has a thing called quote name

412
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,767
Which you can pass to arrays

413
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,839
And the first array being the actual

414
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,631
Name of the

415
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,447
Value which in this case is name and alias

416
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,983
And the second array

417
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
What you wanted to be once the query is completed

418
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,407
So it links this into the the query

419
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,431
One-by-one

420
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,759
See all of those even the category one is linked in here

421
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,039
And then

422
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:01,343
It does a check whether there's an ID

423
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,439
And if it exists it checks whether it's a string

424
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
If it's a string it adds a quote

425
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
And if it isn't if it's a number

426
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
It just adds it directly

427
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
and That is where

428
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Where the query is done

429
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:15,935
And

430
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,263
here basically return false if there is no ID

431
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:23,359
And so we'll look at this area in a moment this is done

432
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,383
To the filtering

433
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
and the wear

434
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Ok

435
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,759
So I just wanted to show how it adds this

436
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:32,063
Preacher as well as series

437
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
To the query

438
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,647
if we Look at the back

439
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,927
Open up here

440
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,463
You see that series

441
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
And preacher

442
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,071
And statistics but statistics

443
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,351
You see we select

444
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:45,631
Multiple statistics

445
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,911
Because for one

446
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
sermon

447
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,751
There can be multiple downloads right

448
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,543
So there's multiple statistics

449
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,615
Oh sorry not multiple downloads multiple files

450
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,943
And per file there will be a a a number

451
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,759
So if we look at how he does that

452
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:05,343
It is first does the query and hearing get item

453
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
It actually

454
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Adds a new function

455
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
Called

456
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:13,279
Get ID sermon statistics and with a

457
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,839
With a random

458
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Key

459
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,679
To ensure that it doesn't conflict with any other method on the page

460
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,239
We had to add this random key here

461
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,847
And it puts it into this variable and that something that you need to

462
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,871
Come and look at

463
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
And

464
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Possibly when we look at the the site

465
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
Layout area as well as the tablets

466
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:37,343
I'll be talking about this transition here again

467
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
And the fact that you need to know

468
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,183
That it is in this variable

469
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:46,303
And I'm trying inside of your layouts and your site views

470
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
and these things I'm trying to give you the correct name

471
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
But it is not

472
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
Water tight correctly

473
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,775
Possibly you need to come and check this if it doesn't just work

474
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,359
But again I'll explain that when we get there

475
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,639
just that you know

476
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
We're adding statistics into this variable through a method which is also on the page and we passing the ID

477
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,343
Of of the sermon

478
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:12,159
So if you look at UI

479
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,975
This exactly what we're saying here

480
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
We're saying

481
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
Okay get statistics multiple

482
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
so we Went to the left

483
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
Can you can select any of these

484
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
And then

485
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:28,287
Use the main table dot ID

486
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,591
Must be equal to e.sermon

487
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,687
And then this is the only values I want to return

488
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:36,479
From the e.sermon

489
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,575
So the e.sermon is this value here

490
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
okay

491
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:46,719
o I'm saying a ID must equal is e.sermon

492
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
And then if you look at the code

493
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,399
It basically if we go to this function which should be just here

494
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,215
there it is. It takes that ID

495
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,239
And

496
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,799
Places that next to e.sermon

497
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,639
and puts into its place

498
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:08,223
Basically also here's the two arrays what it

499
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
What it is in the database and what it should be now

500
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
And

501
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,440
it checks whether executes, checks whether it's got any arrays or any values

502
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,488
And then returns that is an object

503
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
List

504
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
And that then gets placed inside of this

505
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Space inside here

506
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,968
Now you would see this area here

507
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:41,504
Is actually custom scripting

508
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:48,928
So if we go back to the dynamic get you see that there is a custom script area here

509
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,720
If you click on that

510
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,000
You'd see that there is

511
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,536
Different switches

512
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
You can select

513
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
Get list query

514
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,680
Or before getting the items

515
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,472
After getting the items

516
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
If you select after getting the items

517
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
And you place any code there

518
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:09,152
Then data gets dumped right after

519
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
The initial items we've

520
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Received

521
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,016
It will it will add that

522
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Code in there and then only return

523
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,576
The items

524
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:19,648
So that is why you can model the data

525
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,208
Right there in the dynamic get

526
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,744
You gonna write the code

527
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
For the data

528
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:26,048
After it's been get

529
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,328
And you can check

530
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,864
If I remove this

531
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,448
Code here you'd see tells you that there is an array of items

532
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
Where all values are

533
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,288
And then I'm just saying

534
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:40,128
I want to be sure that those items are set and that they are there

535
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
Before I start doing it on each of them

536
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,016
And so again here I'm using

537
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Some double

538
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:51,392
You know the street bracket component helper functions

539
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,928
to check whether the String is there

540
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
So you can dump some nice PHP

541
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:01,888
Even before getting the item you can add some filters or get list query

542
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,704
Before the if you if this is model list

543
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
If this is item

544
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
You'd see that

545
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Then there's a different set of

546
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,104
Switches is available

547
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:13,152
And so it

548
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,432
Adjusts to

549
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
To the type of

550
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
Query type up here

551
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,784
Ok

552
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,576
Coming back to this area

553
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:23,904
Let's again look at the database table option

554
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,816
Basically you see I selected category and it's a single row that's returned I called it b

555
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
I joined it left and I said a

556
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,704
Cat ID must be equal to b ID

557
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,008
Which is the ID of the category

558
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
And I only want

559
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,312
The title

560
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
And the alias

561
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,384
So that is

562
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:45,920
how we set that up

563
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
I need a title in the alias

564
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,016
And it returns that for us

565
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:51,808
Then

566
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:55,392
It links it in there and that's part of what you saw here

567
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,184
when You looked at the query option here

568
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,768
Basically the sixth section here

569
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,352
Now let's look at the filters

570
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
You see where we've a filter

571
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,520
And a where and an ordering and setting of Globals

572
00:24:12,032 --> 00:24:13,568
now the setting of Globals

573
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,640
if you have a value in this query

574
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:20,992
That you possibly want to use in a custom query which isn't even

575
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,600
Setup yet but you want you know I'm gonna need this value in the model

576
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,392
Then you can through this

577
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
Global

578
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
option here

579
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
You can set a global area

580
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,072
now Again here you should maybe test it

581
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
There is an option of using this and State

582
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,424
there is the different type of

583
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Set types

584
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,288
You can set the value to state or you can set the value to this

585
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
And

586
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
here you need to know

587
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:50,176
key so

588
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:52,224
So let's I wanna do the name

589
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,064
Obviously in this case is not gonna work ideal

590
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Because you got more than one name

591
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,440
So usually this Global function only functions well

592
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
When you are returning a single

593
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:07,328
Item so when you only do get item not get list query

594
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,608
But you do get

595
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Item

596
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:13,984
Then this make sense and then you can give it a name

597
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,520
And

598
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:17,568
it will add it to the global

599
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:19,616
Scope of the method

600
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,896
or the model rather

601
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,968
Which you can access through other

602
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Model

603
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Methods

604
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
Which are custom

605
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,576
Methods

606
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,648
Ok so that is setting the global

607
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
The filtering

608
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,744
You have a a list of possible filtering

609
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:37,536
So

610
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,352
Depending on what you wanna do

611
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:45,472
You might select ID or user or access level or group or category

612
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
or Tags or date

613
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:52,384
Some of these are not really well formulated yet like date doesn't work that well yet

614
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:57,504
But categories does user group access level user and ID does well

615
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,600
You know this function variable works well

616
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
and Array

617
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
Array value repeatable value and other

618
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,000
All those already work very well

619
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
And you can already use them and

620
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:11,584
Implement them

621
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:15,168
Now the only way for you to really

622
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:20,544
Know exactly how it works you need to know a little PHP and then you need to

623
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:24,896
compile and go look in the code what it has done and where it's placed what

624
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
And that

625
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
Is

626
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,272
Why I showed you that this is all set in the model

627
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,296
Ok

628
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,320
So currently

629
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,368
We are saying we wanted to

630
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,672
do a J request

631
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Get into here by ID

632
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,768
So this is the

633
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,816
get area that I added

634
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,864
I look in The code it says

635
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,144
State the key

636
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,680
and it's this Here

637
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,496
you see and we set it is a function variable

638
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,824
So it doesn't change or adapt this at all

639
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,408
And then says it must be equal to preacher

640
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
So what we are doing since component builder doesn't know where the this variable is gonna be a string or integer

641
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,416
That's why we have this function which first checks were that is string

642
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:10,464
And then checks whether it's a number

643
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:13,536
And related and builds up the query respectively

644
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,608
You might feel that is too much and

645
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
you're Possibly right

646
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,680
But that is the only way I am implement it at this stage

647
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
And

648
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,568
getting more developers involved

649
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,360
May possibly improve this long run

650
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:33,248
Then you see there the Access

651
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,624
Now we have a bunch of values that fire every time in a custom

652
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,160
Dynamic get model

653
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,768
And it is the these values

654
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,840
And often times you you might need these values

655
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
So instead of you

656
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,728
Having to do custom scripting to get these values on the page

657
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:56,544
We add these values dynamically every time

658
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,152
So the user ID the group The authorised group the access level

659
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,456
The app and then the input values

660
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:05,760
Which by other URL or post

661
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,296
is on the page

662
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,624
And it tells you that it's been initiated

663
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,208
so This is set to true so that if you have custom

664
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Methods

665
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Like this one

666
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
get Preacher

667
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
It's checks whether it's been set

668
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,984
And if it has been set it doesn't set that again it can just use it

669
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,568
But if it hasn't been set it sets it and also again sets it to true

670
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,104
So

671
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128


672
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:35,200
variables Global variables

673
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:40,320
Can then be used inside of the coaches like the global variable we spoke of earlier

674
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
Ok so

675
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,696
Out of that Global variable

676
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
We are

677
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,512
Actually accessing

678
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:50,816
This levels

679
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,864
And so it's this one here

680
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:58,496
Which basically has the get authorized view levels

681
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,288
Of the specific user

682
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,568
That is now

683
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,104
you know accessed this

684
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,944
Model or the view that this model belongs to

685
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:11,040
And if he is in these access levels

686
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,112
So you remember that public is another access level

687
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:19,744
And so if the user isn't signed in he's a public it will this will validate true in the query

688
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,304
Ok so

689
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,144
We set that up simply by adding access level

690
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:26,912
In

691
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
A access

692
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
So you must check in the

693
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Main

694
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,800
Source table

695
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,616
For access

696
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:38,176
And whether this user is in that

697
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
So that means you don't need to add a state key because

698
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
The code is done for you

699
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Ok

700
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,368
That is some of the filters

701
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,648
then the where

702
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
Is you can add any table key

703
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,512
Equals to a certain value

704
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
now that Value could be another table

705
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,096
like b field

706
00:29:56,608 --> 00:30:00,704
or it could even be a global variable like we said we could set up

707
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,800
So it can also be in ID, a user ID now the user ID is already

708
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
On the table so it could be

709
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,384
Just user ID

710
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:15,296
And or it could be like we've done it this case just an integer which is one

711
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,600
So we wanna make sure that all the

712
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,392
Sermons returned

713
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Is published

714
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,720
And if you have an unpublished sermon it shouldn't even

715
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Return it at all

716
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
Ok so That's what we doing with that

717
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120


718
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:32,192
That is setting up a get list query

719
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
With pagination

720
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,264
Through this

721
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:39,360
Ordering method we just saying use the a ordering

722
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,920
and a send now you can order all the items

723
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,992
Just add many as you like

724
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,296
Be sure that the table that you

725
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
ordering

726
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
You could even use a name right

727
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
So could be a name

728
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
As an ordering

729
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,488
Table key

730
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
Then it you could do it a descending or ascending

731
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,400
Then it would be added to the query

732
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Ok

733
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
That is also added ordering

734
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
To the data set

735
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
From

736
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
Your Dynamic get method

737
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:14,944
and so here with the joint view tables you can do very nice

738
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
Dependency

739
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Calls

740
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,832
From other tables in the backend

741
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,928
And bring the data together into one items array

742
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,256
That's basically what Dynamic get is for

743
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
and as you saw

744
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,304
We have

745
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,072
A

746
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:34,144
The normal what I call main source on the table

747
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
sorry in the model

748
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
And then we have this other one called get preacher

749
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
So

750
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
That is another

751
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
Dynamic get function which we

752
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:45,920
Looked at

753
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,224
it's called this one

754
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
Get preacher

755
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,784
if we Open it

756
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,856
We see it's a

757
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
It's a custom

758
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
Get custom

759
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
And we gave it a cluster name called get preacher

760
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,304
and this is It's relationships

761
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,608
So it is basically having No

762
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,144
Relationship there

763
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
Neither here so it's

764
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,984
It's not linking to other tables

765
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,800
It's simply getting the preachers details

766
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:14,592
Right there

767
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
Simple as that

768
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,528
But it has a filter which is basically using the same integer

769
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:28,928
And access levels as the filters

770
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:35,328
It's also using a where I suppose yes published and it doesn't need ordering

771
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:41,728
Because it's just one preacher but I none the less added the ordering I could actually delete this

772
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:48,128
And it doesn't have any globally settings okay so that is get preacher and so from the

773
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:54,528
This settings here I don't think there's custom scripting nope from this settings here

774
00:32:54,784 --> 00:33:00,928
component builder writes all this code

775
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:07,328
You'd see that we have this function everywhere called UI kit comp

776
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:13,728
And then we using a global method a static method get ui comp

777
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:20,128
it's a method that I built if you know uikit if you don't know it go to get UI kit or just google it

778
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:26,528
It's a It's a JavaScript

779
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:32,928
Library CSS JavaScript library which really makes modeling of your views very nice and easy

780
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:39,328
And it has components that you can use

781
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:45,728
So like tool tip and model

782
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
All these kind of models but Gordian is another component

783
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:58,528
And we don't load all of it's components every time so what we've done is we've

784
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:04,928
Written in PHP a method that looks at Fields that are text area fields

785
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:11,328
And normal text Fields no mostly okay it's

786
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:17,728
Not looking at every field is only looking at the text Fields and editor Fields so in in this

787
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:24,128
Component we know that this description field is a

788
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,528
Editor field and so we are sending it to this method now you can go look at this Method Method

789
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,928
In your helper class it's over there

790
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:49,728
Here's the method so

791
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:56,128
So it has the classes that already has been identified which is what this

792
00:34:56,384 --> 00:35:02,528
Initial this component area sorry

793
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:08,928
Field name field value model field value is actually holding

794
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,328
it's Holding any component names that already has been identified this gets

795
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:21,728
past also here with the content then we check in the content whether there is a class UI

796
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:28,128
UK underscore and if it's not false we start looping to check what

797
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
What what are all the components that are in there and here is the list of the components that are available

798
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:40,928
and so On-the-fly we are determining whether these components should be loaded just by

799
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:47,328
Looking at the content that was placed in the description field and then we added back to this

800
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:53,728
Array so it updates this eventually you have an array of

801
00:35:53,984 --> 00:36:00,128
All those items and in the view we go to the view

802
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:06,528
Which in this case is gonna be preacher

803
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:12,928
We open the view dot HTML

804
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:19,328
We get to a place which basically everything is gonna be happening so

805
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:25,728
These are of the components that go in component builder compiled

806
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:32,128
the application it looks inside of the content of your site view as well as your custom admin View

807
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:38,528
and it identify that these components must be loaded for uikit and so it

808
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:44,928
Places it here dynamically but since you could've added some components inside of the script that

809
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:51,328
that is stored in the description area it now has this get uikit component which basically

810
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,728
reach back into the model and in the model gets this

811
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:04,128
Variables value through a method which is here at the bottom of the page there it is

812
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:10,528
Get UI kit component basically through this method it is reaching in

813
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:16,928
Into getting that array and once it has that array we basically check whether it is set

814
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:23,328
Whether it is an array and if it is an array we set

815
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,728
To the array that is already on this page then over here we loop through that array

816
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:36,128
And we load in those components CSS and JavaScript as required

817
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:42,528
so that You always can be sure that the UI kits needed components will be loaded on the page

818
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:48,928
simply by user adding some of that components to its description as style

819
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:55,328
Because the way uikit works is you just like Bootstrap you just Add the class name

820
00:37:55,584 --> 00:38:01,728
To the specific div or tag html tag and then it activates

821
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:08,128
the needed scripting around it which is a nice library but it's

822
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:14,528
Quite heavy and you don't want it on the page every time now I know you could have done this through JavaScript

823
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:20,928
You know it is fact they have a way for you to do this through the JavaScript but to me I felt

824
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:27,328
Let me do the most work in the html so relieve the load on the on the server

825
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:33,728
And that the browser already has much more Leverage and Freedom so that's why we

826
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:40,128
This feature this is maybe Beyond the scope of the get the dynamic get

827
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:46,528
But since we ran into I quickly mentioned it here okay so it is all

828
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
Also placed in the query that is developed by Dynamic get that's partly why it

829
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:59,328
Fits so once you've got your Dynamic get set up you now will add these dynamic

830
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:05,728
Gets to either site views or to admin custom admin views so these Dynamic gets is what

831
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:12,128
What gets the data for you and it's where you model the data that you want to work with and you can then

832
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:18,528
Use them in site views and custom admin views. Now next stop we will look at adding it to a site view and how all of that works. Thank you for watching.
