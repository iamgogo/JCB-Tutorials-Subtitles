00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:04,608
I don't know some of you also encountered

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,168
The reality of having to

4
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:10,496
Sort off limit the drop Downs

5
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:13,568
Of a list field

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:15,360
Based on

7
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,176
It's association with another table

8
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,272
A very common place where we find this

9
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,552
Is for example

10
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:28,160
When you want to load the regions of only one country

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,768
And so I'm gonna show you how I have achieved this

12
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,352
I realize there are many ways to do this and yet

13
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,400
This is how I've done it

14
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,984
Ok so to start off

15
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,264
I have a component

16
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,568
I could use as a illustration

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,616
or job tracking

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,664
Now in this component

19
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,968
Obviously I have a client area

20
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,272
And then I have

21
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,576
Already loaded

22
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,672
I go to admin views you would see there is country and regions

23
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,696
Now

24
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,792
I'm gonna illustrate it on the basis of country and regions but

25
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,376
You obviously can

26
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:11,168
Change the

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,216
Field Concepts and

28
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,264
Replace it with other tables

29
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,544
But

30
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,104
none the less this is what I'll be using

31
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:24,224
And I'm gonna show you how I implemented it in inside the the client's

32
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,552
View because that's basically where most of the work is done

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,880
Ok so I'm gonna open the client View

34
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,352
And then I'm gonna look in the two places we wanna look at

35
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,632
JavaScript

36
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
As well as the PHP area

37
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:49,056
Now I have in various previous tutorials explain some of the

38
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,848
Ajax functionality

39
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
In component Builder

40
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,736
But I realized not all of you

41
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:01,600
Might have watched all the tutorial so I'll explain some of that again

42
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,416
Briefly

43
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
But having said that

44
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,000
We first gonna look at

45
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,816
What we really wanna achieve

46
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
Like I have said

47
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
When you load

48
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
So let me go show you that

49
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
So when you

50
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Start with a client

51
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,384
You would like to choose a country

52
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
And then

53
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,504
Have it load only that country's regions

54
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
That is basically what you want to do

55
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,856
Furthermore

56
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,392
You want to make sure

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,184
when it does that

58
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,512
And you unselect

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
the country it also unselects

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,632
The region

61
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
And so there are

62
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:51,264
Various things we wanna achieve here

63
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,056
So in JavaScript

64
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,360
I'm goining to show you how I've done that

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
I'm just illustrating at the moment one country

66
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:02,784
Maybe I should go put on a few more so just hold on for a second there ok

67
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:08,160
So now if I look it says Australia

68
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
If I click on Australia

69
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,328
You see that it doesn't load any regions in fact that says create a region

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
If I choose Namibia

71
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:22,496
It says select a region and so there's three regions two regions already created

72
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,568
Now as you know by now there is this button

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,360
In some of the

74
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:31,712
Dropdowns which are being added by saying true to the button

75
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:34,272
And so it's very helpful

76
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
For either

77
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,880
Creating or editing existing regions

78
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,000
So if you could sort of selecting a country where there isn't any regions set yet

79
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:46,304
It basically tells you to create one

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,376
And you can then create a region for this country

81
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
And what's nice if you click on this

82
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:52,448
Create

83
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:59,104
You can then simply create your region

84
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,664
Save and close so I don't know

85
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
any of Australia regions so I'm just gonna call it

86
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Region for now

87
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,832
And save and close

88
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
Go back to creating a client

89
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:17,791
If I now

90
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:21,375
Select Australia you see that it's got regions

91
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
So there we go

92
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
Problem solved

93
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:30,079
And that's really what I'm gonna demonstrate how I did that

94
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
So let's get started

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
On a JavaScript side of things

96
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:37,759
I first have

97
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:41,087
Two variables I actually could call them both of var

98
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Doesn't matter

99
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,903
One is an object

100
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,559
And one is simply where we are gonna Store if there is a value already set

101
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
We're gonna store that value

102
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Then on document ready

103
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,471
I simply

104
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,263
Oh yes

105
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,543
Before I continue

106
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,639
Creating the fields

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,735
I obviously make it bring all the regions to the page

108
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
I don't want it to

109
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,087
Leave some regions on

110
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
Unloaded how can I say

111
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,183
Instead what I rather do

112
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:19,743
Is I parse those regions

113
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,535
Into this variable

114
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,679
And then only put those regions that are actually

115
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Part of this country back

116
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:36,383
Into the list of dropdown options that's really what I'm doing so that's

117
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,687
What you also see happening here

118
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,759
Is first thing I'm doing is I am

119
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,319
Doing it for each

120
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,647
On the regions options

121
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,463
And then I'm getting the value

122
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:51,999
I putting it in key

123
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,791
I'm getting the text

124
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
I'm putting it in text

125
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:57,887
And then I'm adding it to Regions

126
00:05:58,143 --> 00:06:00,447
Simply as you would load it in any

127
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:04,799
Any array there

128
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
And then I am also

129
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,943
Getting the value of the set region

130
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,247
And I'm adding that to Region

131
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,295
And then I'm setting the

132
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
The function getregion

133
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
The getregion function is down here

134
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
This area

135
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,047
The first thing we do is we load a little loading show

136
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:29,887
now the loading show or

137
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,191
Rather this class

138
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
ID

139
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,311
Is loaded on the page by Default

140
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
When you

141
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,359
Set

142
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,151
This fade effect

143
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
On ad

144
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,527
Then it by Default loads that class

145
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
With a nice spinner

146
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,367
And so I'm basically

147
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:55,999
If the loading process takes long I'm sort of stopping the user from doing anything

148
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,791
Waiting for that spinner

149
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,327
Don't need to add that

150
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Then I am

151
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Finding

152
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,703
Options

153
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,983
for the region

154
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,031
And I'm removing them

155
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
All of them

156
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,871
Then I'm triggering

157
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,175
An update now this is

158
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,551
This update that we are triggering here list zt is a Joomla function

159
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:22,111
And it's actually

160
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,415
Possibly gonna change in the future

161
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:26,719
So keep that in the back of your mind

162
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,559
It things break it possible is happening right here

163
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,191
Because this as you know the list the of is dynamically generated by Joomla

164
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,983
And so we literally telling it

165
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,287
Draw that list again

166
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
But after having removed everything

167
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Now

168
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,759
We are looking at the country

169
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
So up to here we only touched the region

170
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,183
Now we get the country value the one that is selected

171
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
And we add it to country

172
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,583
We then call the server at this point

173
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,167
And the only thing we are giving the server is the country ID

174
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
up here

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
We have a country ID

176
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,543
We have our

177
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
Get URL

178
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:16,639
Our case is get region

179
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:18,687
Is the task

180
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:21,503
We checking that the token is on the page

181
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
Checking that a country ID is not zero

182
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:25,855
And

183
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
We then basically loading the request

184
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Shooting of an Ajax

185
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,767
We doing it this way because obviously

186
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,583
You wanna do some things after we've got

187
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,887
The result which is this done

188
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
And then we

189
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,215
Set region

190
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
now We throw the result into setregion

191
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,383
We hide the load

192
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:49,663
And

193
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Then

194
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,783
We do some house cleaning on the button

195
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
So that button also gets

196
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Tampered with

197
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:01,183
And I'll show you the region button correct

198
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:03,743
Correction that we are doing down here

199
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
And you can copy this code

200
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:11,423
Test that out obviously you would update this to whatever field you trying to limit

201
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:13,215
only do that

202
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,775
After set region

203
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Now we going to setregion

204
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
setregion is quite simple

205
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
Mainly because we already done most of the work

206
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,159
With the result being returned and so I'll show you the PHP that returns this result in the moment

207
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
so in setregion would get an array

208
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,535
we Check if the array is there

209
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,327
And then we append

210
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
Simply as you would

211
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,679
With any list selection

212
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:45,215
We append the value

213
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
But now

214
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,799
Since we are

215
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
Oh yes

216
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,103
another thing

217
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
I'm almost skipping it

218
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
This select region

219
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,991
Is a

220
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
JavaScript

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,159
Variable

222
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:06,463
That I'm setting through PHP

223
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,279
Which I'll show you in a later

224
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,303
Stage

225
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,863
And basically it's just a string

226
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,423
That says that you should select the region

227
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:18,239
And if there is no array returned

228
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,567
We basically just use the other variable

229
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,127
Create a region which is also just a string

230
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,479
So now over here

231
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
we are going to each over the array

232
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,367
And we are using the ID

233
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:37,183
And we checking whether the ID

234
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,719
In regions

235
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
If it's in regions

236
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:45,887
We append the ID as a value

237
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,471
And as you remember in regions we saved the text

238
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,007
As well as the ID

239
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:53,311
And so that is how we get the text

240
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,615
Simply adding it in there

241
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,503
I know we could have done that in the PHP but I felt a  let's let the

242
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:04,063
The browser help us with some of the lifting

243
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,343
So

244
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:11,231
We got the regions there if it's a huge table you might want it should approach this differently

245
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,583
Eventually we are checking whether the ID and the region =

246
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:19,423
Since if it does your mother ensure to set

247
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:22,239
Region

248
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,311
Value so as your member previously

249
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,359
We found the region value

250
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:30,431
And which store did into region

251
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
Just in case

252
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:36,575
The value was set before and saved

253
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
Now the person is looking through different countries

254
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,999
But when you can select the country that previously was saved

255
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:49,119
We want to make sure that his previous region is also shown as the selected value

256
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
That's simply what we doing here

257
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,775
Then after everything is done we again trigger this

258
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
List

259
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,847
Update

260
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,663
Which is the same as what was triggered there

261
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:07,551
And that basically sets the regions list again afresh

262
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,599
Then only

263
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:12,159
Do we run this little bit of housekeeping

264
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
Which does the Region button

265
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,279
Now the region button

266
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,815
It's actually

267
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,095
A

268
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
JavaScript

269
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
That is added

270
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,239
Because of the list

271
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,871
Field so if your specific list field was said to have no button

272
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,175
You could simply leave this out

273
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,735
If it was said to have a button

274
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:42,111
Then this is the usually the name of the button would be the

275
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,927
This area before the J form

276
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
Underscore

277
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:48,255
This part of the name

278
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:54,143
Would be the first part of the name of the button function and then the last part would be button

279
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,239
So that's how you know and you can obviously on the page

280
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:01,823
Let it execute and search for this function if you aren't sure

281
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,871
But that's how you would

282
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,431
Run

283
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
The button correction

284
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,063
And that's basically

285
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,391
How did JavaScript looks to achieve this

286
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Ok

287
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:22,047
there is a little bit more housework necessary in that's what I said before

288
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:25,375
This area of JavaScript can actually include

289
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,655
PHP

290
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:31,007
that area can not because that's just pure JavaScript file

291
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,591
Where's this is JavaScript added to a PHP file

292
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:41,247
So here we can add some PHP and that's where we get the select region and create region

293
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:47,903
Now I know there is another way to do this in Javascript itself so forgive me for being so sloppy

294
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,439
Anyway

295
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,767
There's this function

296
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:59,423
Which basically when the admin form on change of the country field is

297
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,495
When that event occurs

298
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,823
We want to execute get region

299
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:07,103
so That

300
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,895
Every time

301
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
That is changed

302
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,991
What is the extra bit of

303
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
Script that you need to add these two

304
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,343
If you are gonna

305
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:20,415
Copy this down exactly the same

306
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,743
Just another note

307
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,423
We see then execute this function which is the same function

308
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,471
That we are executing

309
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
On the page load

310
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
We don't need to read execute this

311
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
Simply because that is already been done on the page load

312
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,991
that is all the JavaScript

313
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
But you need to add

314
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
Now let's go look at the PHP

315
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:56,767
Should know by now you do not need to add the PHP to the same admin View

316
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,655
Since all the ajax methods are all added to one file

317
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:07,007
In the component called Ajax the the model

318
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:12,895
As well as the controller is the Ajax model in controller so if you compile the component

319
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,455
You can unzip it and go to the model

320
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,991
To the controller

321
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,551
either in the backend or in the front end

322
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,599
Where is now it will be in the back end

323
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
And it's under models

324
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,951
Auc there's an Ajax model and

325
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
All of the backend

326
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
Ajax

327
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,863
Methods gets added to this one model

328
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:36,959
And so this area is what takes care of the model

329
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
And

330
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,127
And this area here takes care of the

331
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,151
Controller

332
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:48,479
So basically saying the values name is country

333
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,319
the task is get region if no values passed it's Null

334
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,647
And it must be an integer that is past

335
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,975
And the method name is get region

336
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:03,327
And it must be a logged in user that's a simple as that is

337
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,887
That takes care of the whole controller setup

338
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Then here

339
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
we have The method

340
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,543
Called get region it gets the ID

341
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,639
It doesn't need to sanitize it again since the controller already did that

342
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:20,991
You can go look at the controller to see the implementation

343
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:23,551
So we simply getting the

344
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,831
factory

345
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,671
the data base factories passes us the database

346
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:33,023
We set up a query we say that we are looking for the IDs

347
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,583
 in the region

348
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
That are published

349
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
I'm basically where the country

350
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,519
Now this is again where you need to sort of

351
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,103
Make your changes

352
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:52,223
We want the names of the regions or the IDs instead sorry of the regions

353
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
on Their association with the country

354
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,855
so Obviously then in the region

355
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,391
Table

356
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:02,719
We have a a a field a column

357
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,511
That is called country

358
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,047
And it has an ID in it

359
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,839
So that each region

360
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,655
Is linked to a country so whatever

361
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:12,447
Table you're targeting

362
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,775
 this association would be than this country

363
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
And it's obviously

364
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,663
me being paranoid we just add the interger there again

365
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,759
Set the query executed check if you have a value

366
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,111
And if we do we simply return the load

367
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,135
Load column

368
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,183
Function

369
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,999
Which returns the ID is in an array

370
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
There we go done finished

371
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
And

372
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:45,471
There we return false if no value was found and it's simple as that that's all the PHP you

373
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
Need

374
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,031
And that returns

375
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,591
The the PHP to our

376
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,895
JavaScript

377
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:55,199
And the JavaScript does the rest

378
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,991
Ok well

379
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,039
I hope this will be very helpful

380
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:05,695
And help you to sort of sort your dropdowns I didn't spend

381
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:09,023
much time on explaining that maybe I should so let me

382
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
Give a Quik

383
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
Run over of that

384
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
The field that we are

385
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:20,543
Focusing on is this country in the region field and they are both custom right

386
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:26,175
So I've already done tutorials on how to set up a custom field I'm not gonna spend too much on this

387
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
But just for reminder let's open region

388
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,623
we Simply saying the button is true

389
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
And

390
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,791
We select the region you can obviously update the view name dynamically in the description

391
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,887
And here we doing some

392
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
PHP

393
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
you could Put all of this PHP

394
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,007
in just

395
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,311
PHP one

396
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
Without adding it to the 19th

397
00:18:58,431 --> 00:19:00,991
 placement

398
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,343
But like I've done I've actually used every area

399
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,391
I like making the code look

400
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
It was written

401
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,231
and not computer-generated

402
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
And

403
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:18,399
Then I'm adding the options and so this is just a simple basic

404
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:23,263
simple custom field

405
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
there is'nt even any Java script in here

406
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,919
I've Done Everything basically in the model

407
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:36,575
Did the PHP as well as the Javascript sorry not in the model in the back end admin View

408
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:43,231
And I think that is because I wanna use this field maybe in other views with different

409
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,559
Different Association

410
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:50,143
So I don't tend to use the script area

411
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:52,703
Maybe as one might expect

412
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
So that's quickly looking

413
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
At

414
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,943
Filtering a dropdown list selection custom list selection

415
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Via JavaScript

416
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,039
And Ajax therefore

417
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,623
If you are targeting a table of another

418
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:15,231
Component which you're not having the control over 

419
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:21,631
The actual field names it will it should work the same way as long as there is

420
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
A field of

421
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,519
Association within the table that you'd like to filter

422
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
you could write that PHP

423
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:31,871
Find the values and filter it

424
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
Thanks for watching
