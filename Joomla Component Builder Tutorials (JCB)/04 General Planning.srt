1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,072
What do you want to build a component

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,608
In component Builder

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:05,888
You need to come prepared

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,704
There's a number of things that you need to know

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,520
You need to know what you wanna build

6
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,824
You need to know the database structure that you want to

7
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
Set up

8
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,688
These are mostly things that you will only know

9
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,992
If you have a great

10
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:22,528
Good

11
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:23,296
Understanding

12
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
Of

13
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
A table

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,392
And

15
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
A database and

16
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,720
How you

17
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,744
Would like to have it mapped

18
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,072
Now if you do not know that

19
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,608
I could give you some pointers on some of the things you we

20
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:38,656
Needed

21
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,960
And at the same time try to

22
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
explain

23
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Why you need to know these things

24
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
Ok so

25
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,920
We are using

26
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,968
Sermon distributor

27
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,504
which is a component that I've

28
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,272
Developed

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,088
For Distributing

30
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:57,856
Sermons

31
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:00,672
We using that as our demo

32
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
Component that we are demostrating

33
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:05,280
and how to build

34
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:07,584
So you need to know what you gonna called it

35
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,120
So we called it Sermon Distributor

36
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Then

37
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,704
You would need to know

38
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
The backend views

39
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,568
Now the backend views in Joomla

40
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
Must be

41
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Tightly connected

42
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
To a Database

43
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
And possibly

44
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,016
In such a way that it

45
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,296
Makes sense

46
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,344
that the database

47
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,112
Naming conventions and everthing follows soot

48
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,208
I am not going to be able to

49
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,232
To do an extensive

50
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512
Explanation on all this

51
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
By just

52
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
By illustrating what

53
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
Is the best

54
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Convention of implementation

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,472
Obviously component builder will allow you to

56
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:46,240
You break these convenstions

57
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
But later you would

58
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Regret doing so

59
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
And Possibly

60
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
have to

61
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
redo a lot of things

62
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
The purpose being that

63
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:56,736
A lot of these conventions

64
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,016
They add up

65
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,808
To implementation

66
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,368
in other areas like your costum field types and so forth which we will get to in a moment, well not a moment, well not a moment a few videos from now

67
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
Ok so

68
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
We first knew that when we were gonna build

69
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,728
Sermon Distributor

70
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
That is four field

71
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,824
Sorry backend views

72
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,360
Needed to

73
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,128
To be set up

74
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:25,920
Because we wanted these

75
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
Features

76
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:27,456
Inside of our component

77
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,272
And that is the sermons

78
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,808
I had a

79
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,576
List View

80
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,344
Of

81
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Sermons and

82
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:34,880
as well and

83
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Editing

84
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
View of a sermon

85
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
And they shared a common data

86
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
Database table

87
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,072
And so we had preachers

88
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
As well as

89
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Series list

90
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,192
And series And statistic and statistic

91
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,592
And they all share and as you can see they actually

92
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:56,128
Represent two

93
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
Views

94
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,200
But one database table

95
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
That means two views a listview

96
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:10,464
And an edit view and you will hear me repeat these concepts over and over and if I get

97
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
Confused are please forgive me as just so much repetition that you need to understand that

98
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,520
When I talk about views plural I always talking about the list View

99
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,824
If I talk about View

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Singular

101
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:33,248
I'm always talking about the editable view which is basically in relation to the backend relay

102
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:38,112
Sorry connection of the database itself

103
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,720
So you backend usually forms the connection to the database

104
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:47,328
Your frontend is much more dynamic and that's why we also have a dynamic

105
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:53,728
Get concept which links to site views which is the front of your component these

106
00:03:53,984 --> 00:04:00,128
Things will take quite a lot of explanation if you not new if you sorry if you're new to coding and

107
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:03,456
PHP and all that JavaScript CSS

108
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
You possibly get lost but if you're not you'll be very happy in the way with implemented because it leaves

109
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:15,232
With a lot of Dynamics and maneuverability

110
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:21,631
Which is obviously partly why I developed this component because all the others felt

111
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:28,031
Other component Builders out there felt like a cookie cutter you know you you can really only

112
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:34,431
Crank out components that are sort of common to each other and

113
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:38,527
I wanted to build something that's really Dynamic so

114
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:44,927
Partly for that the site views and the custom backend views are

115
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:51,327
Mostly the same kind of implementation both drawing their data from The Dynamic get

116
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,119
Feature in component builder

117
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:58,751
So you can think of these two, three sorry as working as a team

118
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
But the backend views stand as the database for these

119
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,807
So you need to set up these first and add to them

120
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:16,415
All the necessary Fields which will then map the database

121
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
Columns which you can then through the dynamic get connect to so that you can

122
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,863
Formulate a data model

123
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:31,263
Which can be reused in your custom backend and in your sight views so I don't know

124
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,823
Does that explain it to you let me try again

125
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:40,223
Just to make sure I have everybody on the same page your backend views are very

126
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,623
Tightly connected to database structures so even if you were to look at

127
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
Component Builder itself

128
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,999
You have what is called components

129
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
And if you were to open one it has fields in it

130
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:02,495
And if you want to go to the database

131
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
And also open component Builder

132
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,407
Component the same table

133
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:14,783
And you to click on structure you would see that the fields

134
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,343
That we are seeing

135
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
Here

136
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
Here name name in code version version updates

137
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,791
Bugs

You see it really directly Maps to the database and it is in a way

146
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,535
Editing the database through this view

147
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
So

148
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:05,471
When it comes to the components you're your backend views are all being limited to this kind of

149
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
Structure

150
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:13,407
And this is not a limitation on component Builders behalf really it's really the way Joomla

151
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:19,807
wants you to implement it by doing it this way your class is your model your controllers and

152
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:26,207
Everything else just behave right because of that implementation now I know some might feel

153
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
that is a major limitation but that is the Joomla API's implementation and if you want to

154
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
Go Beyond that kind of infrastructure you must probably need to look at another

155
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:46,943
Way than using component builder because we only implemented it that way so that your

156
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:52,319
Your backend views directing Maps to the database

157
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
But because we know that from time to time there is backend views that do not have even there own

158
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:05,119
Database but rather takes these already saved information in the database

159
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,007
Either from other third-party components or even your own component because we know that

160
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:17,407
You would like to take that information and remodel it maybe into a spreadsheet

161
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,967
Or into a

162
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
Table sorry not a  table but a chart

163
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,087
or Any other kind of

164
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:31,487
Way we added this custom backend views which behaves on the same Dynamics as

165
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
The site views which means

166
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:39,167
We trying to give you Best of Both Worlds first being that

167
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:44,799
Strong tightly tight

168
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
Tighting manage maybe datasets which relates directly to the view and the list View and so forth

169
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
But at the same time the option of adding a custom backend view which can be dynamic and

170
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:08,095
You know you can really do custom scripting in it you need not need to be concerned about all the other

171
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,399
Overheads as you would usually be

172
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,703
So

173
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:19,103
You first need to know your backend views and then any possible custom views

174
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
That maybe combines backend view so we could possibly in the future we haven't done so yet

175
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:30,879
Possibly takes statistics and sermons

176
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:36,255
And Preachers and series's because these statistics

177
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,559
Are taking only the downloads

178
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:43,167
Where us preachers has in them a field called hits

179
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,335
And so does sermons have a field called hits that's just when someone opens one

180
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:54,943
Without downloading is necessarily so does series's

181
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
But statistics only counts the downloads of sermons so we could possibly add an extra

182
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:04,927
Backend field sorry View custom backend view

183
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:08,255
Called

184
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,047
Analysis

185
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,119
or anything

186
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,423
And

187
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,775
Then in analysis we can use the dynamic get

188
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
Option

189
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:26,431
To get data from

190
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
all through those tables

191
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,599
These tables basically from that one

192
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:37,951
And

193
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,767
Preacher table

194
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
And a series table

195
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,007
Let's shortened it a little by removing

196
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:55,359
That

197
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
and statisctics

198
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,111
And then from them

199
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
Do what we would call model

200
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Modelling

201
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,863
Modelling the data

202
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
And possibly end up with

203
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,703
A whole new

204
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,519
Data structure which we can then

205
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:26,591
Place into a table or into a

206
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:28,895
Chart

207
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,991
In that view which means that it is now dynamic

208
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
And no longer directly connected

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
To the

210
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,367
Database

211
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,647
As these above

212
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:40,927
Views are

213
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,535
And it won't won't really have an edit view it will be a Single View

214
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Just displaying rows

215
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
An analysis data

216
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,167
From does multiple backend

217
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Database

218
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,727
Tables

219
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,775
And this

220
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:58,591
Can also be done on the front of the site

221
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,127
So

222
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,663
That means this whole

223
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:02,687
Get

224
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,223
Feature

225
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
We could

226
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Take it

227
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,575
Put it under get

228
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,159
And we can give it a name and we can call it

229
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
It is the analysis

230
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,023
Get

231
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,815
Get analysis

232
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,351
We could call it that

233
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:24,959
And then the analysis view basically get used to get analysis

234
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
To get the data

235
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
And then

236
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,847
Takes that data and models setting

237
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,127
Sorry

238
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,151
Displays it

239
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,175
on a Page

240
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,735
And the same can be done

241
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
To the front

242
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
So the same

243
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,343
Dynamic get can be use in

244
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
The front again

245
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
So that's sort of how component builder works

246
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,511
If you not looking at the fields itself

247
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:52,607
The fields is a discussion on its own but

248
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,471
This which I have now sort of just typed out your very basic and alimentary

249
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,567
Is really what you need to know before coming to component Builder

250
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,407
You need to know what you want to achieve

251
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:06,175
What do you want to

252
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
Build

253
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
And

254
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:11,039
If possible map the field

255
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:12,319
Under each of these

256
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
So in sermons we will have name

257
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,415
And

258
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,951
We will have

259
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
Preacher

260
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Right

261
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
And we'll have series

262
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
And we will have

263
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Files

264
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Right

265
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
So they should be under

266
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:33,567
Sermons that under preacher

267
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,127
We will have also name

268
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
And we will have

269
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Maybe email and

270
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,551
discription and

271
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,391
Website and what else

272
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
Oh maybe I can't

273
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,815
I can't hear

274
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:59,935
Same goes for series

275
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,287
We will add a name

276
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
And

277
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,663
I think that will be

278
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,711
Description of course and

279
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:22,719
by statstics since we only counting downloads we will have a

280
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
File name

281
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,327
And

282
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,143
We will have a counter

283
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,239
And we will have a sermon

284
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,775
Which is the ID

285
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,919
but let's just leave it as sermon

286
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
for now

287
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
And

288
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
That will be it

289
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,111
So

290
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,647
That means if you can

291
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,183
Somehow

292
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Map these things

293
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:58,047
Before hand it will help you tremendously

294
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,583
The reason being

295
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,607
That

296
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,655
If you start in component Builder

297
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
You can

298
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,983
Start by creating

299
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,311
A new component

300
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:14,175
And you can add name and all this information

301
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:20,575
But then you'd get to obviously you would skip most of these for the initially just getting started

302
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,647
You just set up these Fields that are compulsory

303
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
the ones with the Stars

304
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
And

305
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,839
This component image that tells you here

306
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:32,607
the Dimensions right

307
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
300pix X 300pix

308
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:38,495
And you must put it in the image folder

309
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,311
And then you can access it from here

310
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Let me see

311
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:46,431
This version updates

312
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Is a

313
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:51,551
Nice feature which we will really look into detail later

314
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:54,111
So you'll add all these compulsory fields

315
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,391
At settings

316
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,927
You would hardly do anything at this stage

317
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,815
Scripts as well you just leave blank read me also blank

318
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,607
Then add views

319
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
After you've saved the component once I mean

320
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:12,543
That means you've Now added name and you've added these and you clicked save

321
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:13,823
Then

322
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,151
You'd basically be able to start adding views to it

323
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,735
Now the way to add a view to a component

324
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:23,807
Is different from the way to create a view

325
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:27,391
You adding the view through the settings tab

326
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:34,047
But you can create new views through this area and you can also see you're ready connected views

327
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,399
and I'll explain this again so maybe this is gonna be a duplication

328
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,471
What are you really primarily wanted to show you

329
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,543
Is that if you start building a component

330
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,383
You feel very lost if you do not know where you going

331
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
And

332
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,039
This will help you know where you going it will help you know it you need to set up these views

333
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,623
And you need to add these Fields to those views

334
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
And

335
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:06,559
That that kind of information and knowing how to construct this is something that you

336
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,631
Need to know before hand

337
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,703
Now obviously you can always add more fields

338
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:19,103
And you can obviously add more views it's not that you need to be that forough and be That sure that you didn't miss

339
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:19,871
Missed something

340
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
It's more that you just need to know what you wanna do

341
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,039
Component Builder cannot decide that for you

342
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:33,439
And you need to realise it you literally have to create all of these Fields before you can add them

343
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,231
Into a view and this

344
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Line

345
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,327
Are seen as a view although it

346
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
When it's compiled will represent two views

347
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,447
It is in component builders

348
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,727
Component

349
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:47,263
Backend views

350
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,799
It's seen as one view

351
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,103
And these

352
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:56,479
Fields will need to be created before they can be added to this view in the same goes with these

353
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,295
The nice thing though is the name field

354
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,391
Can You can create it once and use it reuse it

355
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,671
3 times

356
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
So you can reuse the name field

357
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,559
You can also use the hits well

358
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,095
Sorry the hits

359
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,887
Are already added

360
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,215
By Default so you don't need to add an hits field

361
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:21,055
We'll be talking about the default Fields later

362
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,895
In showing you which Fields you don't need to add

363
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,687
Yourself but it's add dynamicly

364
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
To each backend View

365
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,575
This being a backend View now

366
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:39,231
This is also a backend view but I'm I would always mention that there is a custom backend View

367
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:43,839
The purpose being that it doesn't directly related to a single Database

368
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:48,703
What gives you the option of pulling from multiple databases as I've explained here

369
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:52,031
And modelling the data and then displaying it

370
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:57,407
So that's sort of a quick overview of how to get started with a component

371
00:18:57,663 --> 00:19:03,807
I realise there's so much more to say but it's very difficult to cover all of that and

372
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,367
Hopefully as we go along

373
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,671
Whatever questions still remain

374
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,207
Will be answered

375
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,999
We will be starting

376
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
At fields

377
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:16,607
So it seems sort of turned around right

378
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
You might feel we must start at the component

379
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:21,215
and then build the views

380
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:24,287
And then build the fields and you possibly right

381
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:29,919
And you can do that I mean you can after having created the component

382
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,991
You can click your own admin views which is the first

383
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
Things you need to create is the admin views

384
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:39,903
And click new and create an admin view but again even there

385
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:46,303
You just like with the component only be able to set the bare bone information and not all the needed

386
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
more

387
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,471
Nitty gritty complex information if I could say it so

388
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:56,031
And that's why I usually

389
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:57,055
Sorry wrong file

390
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:02,431
I usually start at the bottom the bottom and work my way up

391
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:07,551
I usually start with creating all the fields I know I'm gonna need so I will basically

392
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,879
Collapse this take these away

393
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Like that

394
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,047
And

395
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Just go create all these fields

396
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,191
And when I see there are duplicate Fields I would remove them

397
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
Because I know we use them

398
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:29,567
So I'll just create Fields that I know are unique

399
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,919
And then when I come to certain Fields Like These

400
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
These are custom fields

401
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
These I won't create initially

402
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
These are the custom fields

403
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,007
These are custom fields

404
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,311
And I won't create them initially

405
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:05,407
So I would also separate the custom field now how do I know it's a custom field

406
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,711
well because the preacher

407
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:13,343
Is a I wanted to pull IDs from the preacher view so if we

408
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,704
Ok let's mark those custom Fields again

409
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:38,688
I would like to have

410
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
This field basically link to that name right a list of these names

411
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:49,696
And the same for the series I would like it to link to that value

412
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
And

413
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:54,560
In Joomla you can create what is known as custom fields

414
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,888
And component builder makes provision for you to do so

415
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:01,216
But this is what I would call an advanced field

416
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,592
And so we'll only look at advanced custom fields

417
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,896
After we've looked at creating

418
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
Normal fields

419
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
And creating

420
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,040
Actually back end views

421
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:19,904
Because only then will you understand the implementation of this custom

422
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:25,536
Field since it will be linking to a back end views value you see

423
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,096
It is not just linking to a bunch of values it is

424
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,632
Linking directly

425
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:36,032
To this back end views value called name and so we can't really create it until we

426
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:42,432
Really know how this is gonna look and that's why we will be only looking at that after I possibly

427
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,480
Explain this again but

428
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Just that we

429
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,064
Let you know where we're going

430
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:51,136
Building a component needs these kind of things

431
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,952
thought through and sort of mapped out

432
00:22:54,208 --> 00:23:00,352
Some of us might not need to write it down some of us do depends on who you are

433
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,704
To me that doesn't really matter even if you have these things in your head

434
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,568
As long as you come to component builder knowing exactly well sorry that's the wrong word

435
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
At least knowing partially what you want to achieve and what you want

436
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
 to build

437
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,064
Now that means you can do a lot of paper

438
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,672
Planning and do do a lot of sort of structuring

439
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:30,048
Of your component long before actually getting to component builder itself

440
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,840
And that's really what this

441
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,888
Short

442
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:36,704
Tutorial was trying to illustrate

443
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
That if you haven't done this you might get lost and not know where you're heading when you start mapping

444
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
The Fields and the views and the

445
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,200
Things in component build itself

446
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
Well thank you for watching

447
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,272
Next stop

448
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,576
Start looking at Field types

449
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:55,136
And then we'll look at using field types

450
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
to create fields

451
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:58,976
And so slowly we'll be

452
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,816
Progressing to eventually ending up with having this component

453
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,376
Fully functional and working

454
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:09,472
And we will be illustrating all of these

455
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,080
Fields as they relate to this back end views that

456
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,360
 are linked to

457
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,152
Database tables

458
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,688
And

459
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:20,224
Hopefully that will give you

460
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,272
A good enough insight and

461
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
understanding

462
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,576
of how all this should be done

463
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,392
Ok thank you for watching
