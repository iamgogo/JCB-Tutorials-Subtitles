1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,304
I would like to show you

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,376
How to change the values that are being exported

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:08,192
And how to then

4
00:00:08,704 --> 00:00:09,984
Have custom import option

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,800
With an import of the data

6
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:14,848
At the moment

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
Component builder actually allows you

8
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
To have

9
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,528
Import and export by Default in all the list views

10
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,320
Of the components you build

11
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:27,648
So let's look at what I mean

12
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:32,000
Here I have a component called IP data

13
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,072
Basically used to take

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
IP address and

15
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:40,960
Translate it to what country it was from and then

16
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,312
To update the pricing on your website based on that IP data

17
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:46,848
So

18
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:47,872
Obviously

19
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,944
You might want to export or import stuff

20
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Into this component

21
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
So I'm gonna have us look at for example let's say

22
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:04,512
Let's take the IP tables

23
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,328
So here we have the IP tables

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,888
And as you can see

25
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
We are able to see the

26
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,800
The CNTRY value

27
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:19,360
And that is basically the country and the

28
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
The REGISTRY

29
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,944
Who this IP table belongs to

30
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
And The Range

31
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,528
That is being reflected

32
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
And all this values are here. Now if you click export without selecting any

33
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,232
Values  will give you this warning

34
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
So

35
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
Obviously you can only export the values that are selected so if you want to export them all you need

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,704
Change this value to all

37
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,776
And in some cases if the table is too big

38
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,872
That means you might not be able to export them all at once

39
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:57,504
Any anyway exporting the data that such big quantities is not really ideal

40
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,832
I would say anything Beyond 3000 items

41
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,136
Rather go to MySQL

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
Get a dump file it's not ideal to use that kind of quantity with in Joomla anyway

43
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
Although we have often seen the listview being used for up to

44
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:20,288
10000 registered sorry items and quite complex

45
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,592
Inheritance in structure

46
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,920
We're talking about the import export now and that's quite different

47
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,760
Ok so for our purpose

48
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,600
Let's say we wanna exporter this but let's say for some reason

49
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Instead of us

50
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,792
Wanting to see if this zzz or AUS

51
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
Value

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,400
We want to instead see the country name

53
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:51,008
Ok so that would be a simple implementation of what I'm trying to explain

54
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:53,568
So if you would clik export now

55
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,360
Let's do that

56
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
And then let's just save this

57
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,296
Ok so we've exported it

58
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:07,136
And instead it put these AUS values here

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,744
And some other values from the database all nicely exported

60
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,304
And that's what you would expect

61
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,656
But if you wanted this to be a different value when you export it

62
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:21,728
Then you can do the following

63
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:26,080
The way component builder works

64
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,104
Is its

65
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,384
Got this

66
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
Get export data

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Method in the model

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
And

69
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,064
This

70
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:41,952
Get export data method has this extra value set to True called export

71
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,744
or _export

72
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:49,120
A reason why we added this is because it is actually

73
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,936
Using the same structure

74
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
Of getting the data

75
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,312
As you would

76
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
When

77
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,432
Let me rephrase this

78
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:05,760
You're able to

79
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,784
Target

80
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,344
This method with custom scripting

81
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:15,488
But the difficulty is that you see this part that's custom scripting

82
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
And it's also been added

83
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,863
Into the actual

84
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:23,935
Get list query right there you see

85
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
It's the same custom scripting

86
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:28,287
So basically

87
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:33,919
In our compiler we are adding the same custom script into the get list query

88
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,711
As we are adding

89
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
Into the get export data

90
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
It's the same custom scripting

91
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Now the way that you would

92
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,207
Know where is it executing is based on this value

93
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
This value is not set

94
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:50,815
In the list query of course

95
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,351
It is only set

96
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
In the export data

97
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:57,727
So let's see where this custom scripting is done

98
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:01,567
So if you got your

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:06,687
Admin view open you go to PHP and then you scroll down

100
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Until you see the method where is it now maybe I should scroll slower is it that one yeah I think it is this one here

101
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,591
Right

102
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,479
Until you see the method it says get list query J model list

103
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,039
That's the the

104
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
The one and you'd said yes

105
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,647
The the code you put in here

106
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
Is added both to the

107
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
Get list query

108
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
As well

109
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
as to the export query so if you want to change the values

110
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,287
that are being exported

111
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:10,687
But not the values that's being shown in your component you be doing it in the same area

112
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
So going back here you'd see that it's that's the same code over here that is

113
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:22,463
Also added over here  you see that's the same code

114
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,767
So if you were for example

115
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
In here you wanted to change some value you could do that

116
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,959
by simply

117
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
Adding another lookup or something and you add this

118
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,895
export is true

119
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:45,759
Now to see where all this export = true is appearing

120
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,039
We would go to

121
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
Any

122
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:50,623
Model which is obviously a list model

123
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:55,231
And we would search and see there it is

124
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
And there it is again

125
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:02,143
So where are we now we are now in the get export data

126
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,543
And we are in the area where is looking remember we showed you in the previous tutorial

127
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:10,847
How to add some customisation

128
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
to your values in the listview

129
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:19,807
Some HTML well here we are asking is the export set or is it true

130
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Then

131
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,111
Don't do this

132
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
You know

133
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,439
Don't don't add this feature here

134
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
So we are avoiding adding this

135
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:34,143
Customisation of coloring because we don't wanted to run when we are exporting exporting we only wanted

136
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:39,007
The values so then again you can see where using the export values

137
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
And

138
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Then again there

139
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
So those are there

140
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
The places where the export

141
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
Function is coming in

142
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,063
To play and how we can

143
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,599
By using this

144
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,391
Underscore export

145
00:07:56,927 --> 00:08:03,071
We are able to identify whether it's an export or not if it is we can make the changes to the values as we like

146
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,375
Ok

147
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,703
Then going back to our back end

148
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Just to show you

149
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,799
This is the place where we did the query

150
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:18,431
And this is the place

151
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,527
Before the translation fix, decryption again

152
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,855
We are checking whether we are doing an export

153
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,671
And so you could literally take that

154
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,255
And say

155
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,631
Instead of the exclamation that if it's export is set

156
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:45,567
Come on and export

157
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,455
And export is true

158
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,503
Then over here you know

159
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:05,279
Do you think in that area there so that is if you want to change the values

160
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
Before translation or before decryption or if you want to you can do it after

161
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
After that

162
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,543
So after all was done

163
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079
You wanna change the values

164
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
On an export

165
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,663
Then you can add it there

166
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:24,479
And that is really as simple as it is

167
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
Adding a

168
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,575
Change to your exported values

169
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Now

170
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,671
If you want to then

171
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Have a different import

172
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Type as usual

173
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,583
Usually to import values you just

174
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
Update these right and if you leave the ID in it updates if you take the ID out

175
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:47,775
It creates

176
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:50,079
So without an ID it will create

177
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
With an ID it will update

178
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,687
Now let's say you say we you know what

179
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
I actually don't wanna use the IDs

180
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
I want to use these values instead

181
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
And then you need to create a custom import concept now we have tried to make that

182
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
Easy as possible and yet

183
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,375
I'm sorry to say that it's still quite complex

184
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,399
So

185
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,727
You basically go to custom import

186
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,055
And then obviously there is a little warning here

187
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
Because it is quite daunting

188
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,663
You that there yes

189
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,735
And it will load

190
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,271
Into these areas

191
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:33,599
The actual script

192
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,647
That are used by Default

193
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
In these various concepts

194
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,279
Now if you do not understand what you seeing here

195
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:45,375
Then I suppose you should rather not be trying to do this

196
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:47,167
Or you should

197
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
Then seek some

198
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:53,567
Classes maybe from lynda.com or elsewhere

199
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,871
I think Udome it's also a good place

200
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,455
Sort of sharpen up some of your PHP skills

201
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
And

202
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:06,367
Then you could make changes to this for example maybe just take out that chunk

203
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
And

204
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:09,951
Then

205
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Do a search

206
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
You know so put something in you can find like

207
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Your name or whatever

208
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,447
And then save this and compile it

209
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:22,751
And then go and search where does this come up

210
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,311
Where does this come out what what is happening

211
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
And then

212
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,639
Obviously

213
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:30,687
You'd realize that

214
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:34,015
We don't completely remove the default

215
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,551
Import method

216
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
When you do this kind of

217
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,111
Changes

218
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,207
There is a way that you could make these changes

219
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
And have two import methods next to each other

220
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:50,655
It's not that easy but it's possible and it all depends on really

221
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,727
What you doing and where is it now

222
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,311
not save area

223
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:58,591
But

224
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:03,199
This area the HTML and PHP View area

225
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,343
So it depends on what you do in the view so currently this is set up to do your normal

226
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,927
Import as you would usually do

227
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:18,047
So changing this will also change your normal import concept

228
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Ok so

229
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
That is how you would

230
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
In this area you would

231
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,519
Change your custom import concept

232
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,359
Please read through the code

233
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:33,151
Maybe compile it

234
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:34,687
Go look at what it's done

235
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,807
Look around see how the default import and

236
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
Concepts work

237
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
And then make your changes accordingly

238
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:49,023
I have used this area quite a lot for various applications

239
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,863
Because sometimes you have a user that says to you or client

240
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,191
I want to import these sets of

241
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,495
Csv files

242
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,567
and they are like 4000 or

243
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:06,175
40000 lines and it needs to select only specific values

244
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,527
Well in that case this area is definitely what you looking for

245
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:16,415
And you'll be able to actually adapt your import concept to accommodate those kind of complexity

246
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,999
Well that is how to

247
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,607
Change export values and create custom import values

248
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,399
For any field

249
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,215
View in the backend of your component

250
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:34,335
So literally changing how that button behaves and how that one behaves is what I have just shown you. Thank you for watching.
