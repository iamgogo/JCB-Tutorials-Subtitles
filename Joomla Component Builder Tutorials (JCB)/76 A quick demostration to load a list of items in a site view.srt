1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,424
We want to do a quick demonstration of how to build a little bit more advanced

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,704
List View

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:13,568
the type that you would find in sermon distributor

4
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:19,712
this list view is comprised of templates and layouts

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,504
And various

6
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:25,600
Integrations so let me

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:29,184
Take one of them and change them

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:30,976
to

9
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:34,304
Yeah to be our example

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
So first of all

11
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
we've just looking at the site views already there so there's Sermon Preachers, Preacher series's

12
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,592
Categories category

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,384
And an API

14
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,200
So

15
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:54,272
I think we'll use this

16
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
preacher

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
Because it is a

18
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:01,440
List query

19
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,024
So let's go look at its Dynamic get

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,816
Now

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
There are two ways for us to build

22
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,240
a

23
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:17,312
List of items in a site View

24
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:20,384
Before I go into the dynamic get

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,432
I need to just

26
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,224
Show you the difference here

27
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,808
The one way

28
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,088
Which I prefer

29
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Is the Ajax Way

30
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,208
Because I can load up to 10000

31
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
rows

32
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
Or items

33
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,304
The page

34
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,168
Where is the normal way and that's the dynamic Get way

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
Can only load

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Quite

37
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,592
Yeah let's say

38
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,152
In a way that is

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,944
Not too slow

40
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,088
About 100 items per page and so you basically need to use pagination

41
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,392
If you don't use pagination

42
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:08,256
It takes very long for the page to load if it's more than 100 items

43
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:13,632
If you wanna load more than 100 items I suggest you go the Ajax Way

44
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
Ajax I'm using footable plugin

45
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,312
And it is

46
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,384
Yeah I assure there's other ways to do it

47
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,712
like most things

48
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:29,248
It's the thing I

49
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
The plugin that I have been using for many years now and it's always

50
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,744
been improving the developers are constantly improving it

51
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,816
And if we If we open this

52
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,608
This URL here

53
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,656
let me open that

54
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:50,752
I'm going to refresh the page

55
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,080
To give you a full idea of what we're talking about

56
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
So going to refresh it

57
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:03,040
Now scroll down here is the example we count 1234 and there we go it's now

58
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:07,392
in that moment we waited it loaded 10000

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976
Rows which is a 1000

60
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:18,656
Pages so if I click here to go to the very last one you see it's 10000

61
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
Items and I mean it was very quick in loading those items into this table

62
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,872
Why I like

63
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
FooTable so much is if you

64
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
Now resize your screen here

65
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:35,296
it will automatically

66
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:42,976
Load those items like this and I know there is such library also in

67
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,000
Joomla

68
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,792
I realize that

69
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
And

70
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240
Are you welcome to use any of those I just like this

71
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,776
Components approach

72
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,592
Look at our little JavaScript you need

73
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,616
On the page

74
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
To basically need a URL

75
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,784
To the column headers which are basically these values

76
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
And

77
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,624
Then you need a URL to get the Json

78
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
And

79
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,512
That's the only HTML you need on the page

80
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
And that's as simple it is to load 10000

81
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:26,239
Items like that in a table

82
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:29,567
It has interesting

83
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:36,223
Opportunity even with regarding to editing if I scroll down here

84
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:36,991
Here

85
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
It has editing rows

86
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,575
Option here

87
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,879
And the editing rows option

88
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
Gives you option to add new rows

89
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:48,767
And edit existing rows

90
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:55,167
I mean this is crazy load a 10000 size

91
00:04:55,423 --> 00:05:01,567
Table of 10000 items and then edit any of them I really think this plugin and it is a amazing

92
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:02,335
Tool

93
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,919
And I'm not even that good with JavaScript

94
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,295
and I can manage this, so I'm sure all of you would be able to do the same

95
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:14,111
I'm not gonna demonstrate

96
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
This now I don't have time it's a little bit more complicated I suppose

97
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Because I need to show you how to build

98
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,887
These

99
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:31,519
And maybe we can look at that but I'm first going to

100
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,567
To look at

101
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,615
This normal

102
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:42,015
Implementation that uses Dynamic get because in any case usually if I'm going

103
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:42,783
This way

104
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,183
I first build something here and then move it there that's how I do it but that's just me

105
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
Let JCB write some of the code for me and I move it to the a to the Ajax basically

106
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,607
backend

107
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,375
Ok

108
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,655
So

109
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,191
Back to our component

110
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,983
We have

111
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,287
a few dynamic gets here already

112
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
All of them

113
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,871
are list queries

114
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:08,895
So

115
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:10,431
That means

116
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
They are able to get more than one item from the database now

117
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:23,231
The request was made to get all the sermons and not have a filter

118
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,303
Which is quite easy I'm gonna use this one

119
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,399
And I'm gonna just change this to

120
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,423
To all

121
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,239
Then

122
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,031
I'm going to the tweak

123
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,591
And I'm going to

124
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:41,663
Just remove that one option

125
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,991
I'm gonna leave the access level

126
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,527
You know what

127
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:53,439
That's just good practice you have access levels in your tables and

128
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:58,303
The user isn't supposed to access an item it's always good to

129
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:04,703
not allow them if you don't want any filter you simply remove this

130
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,727
This

131
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,287
And you can even remove the ordering

132
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,847
and it will work ok

133
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,127
So

134
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,271
That is all you need to do to get all of the sermons from the table

135
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,599
I am going to

136
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,367
Just

137
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
Remove this one for my purpose we can look at the joint options and they seem ok

138
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,815
Leave them that way

139
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,887
And then the custom scripting

140
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
What I'm doing here

141
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519
With a custom scripting

142
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:45,919
I'm basically setting up links links to the series links to the categories

143
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,967
Links to the actual sermon

144
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,271
Links to the series

145
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
And

146
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,647
Basically first create a Slug

147
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
And then

148
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,487
This helper route

149
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:01,279
Get sermon route

150
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:07,679
Get series route and get category route Is a helper class which

151
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:14,079
Is common in Joomla for your router now I'll show you how where to find this class

152
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,663
So if we go to

153
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
The

154
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:24,319
Front-end not the administrative area but the front end and we go down to sermons

155
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:28,159
Are we go to helpers no not helpers

156
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:35,071
Yeah it is actually helpers we going to helpers then we see there is a file called route

157
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,119
So we open that

158
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:40,447
And that is where you find the

159
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,495
Route helper class

160
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,543
So in our code

161
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,383
I have used this placeholder option

162
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:52,223
Which dynamically add the word sermon distributor

163
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,527
To helper route

164
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,343
And that's simply were

165
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
Where it builds this class name

166
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,559
How does class is loaded into the component dynamically so you don't need to do it again

167
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
And it's doing it here

168
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:12,447
You see there is registering the class

169
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,495
In the main

170
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311
PHP file of the component

171
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:23,455
So now in this class we have some static functions get Sermon route

172
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,343
Get preacher route get preachers plural and preacher

173
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,367
Singular

174
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,975
And categories and category

175
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,255
And

176
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
Series list

177
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,583
And series

178
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:41,119
And

179
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,399
API

180
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,703
And that's about it

181
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,103
So that's where I get the names if I am going to Target any of these areas

182
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:57,503
I'm coming in here and I can see how it's building it basically just

183
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:03,391
Building the link right it's grabbing the necessary string

184
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:06,975
With the right option the right View

185
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:12,095
Adding the ID then we have a little function here find item

186
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,471
Which is in the same class you can search for it it's way at the bottom

187
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,519
Just give it a little space there

188
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:25,919
and what this does and I mean if any of you feel you can do this better please make a pull request

189
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:26,687
Let me know

190
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,527
It's trying to find where this item

191
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,623
Which we're building this link is maybe linked to a menu

192
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:38,207
So that we can append

193
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,999
The menu ID

194
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,535
To the item

195
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:47,167
And doing that get the correct URL

196
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,799
Ok so that's what that's all about and then like I said we get the ID

197
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,919
We dump it in here we add the item ID to the link and we return the link

198
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Now

199
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Back in the

200
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,759
Code here

201
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,855
We add just one little tweak and this is this route

202
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:12,511
Jroute which converts that long URL to whatever the system

203
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
Setting is currently in regards to your search engine optimisation so that's what this

204
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
String here

205
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:25,055
Is all about it is basically creating links based on The Slug

206
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:31,455
Now The Slug is a concept which takes the Alias is of an item and it's ID

207
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
Combines it with his double

208
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,343
With this colon between it

209
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,415
So that

210
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:45,791
You can use it in your search engine optimisation router ok

211
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
So that's what this custom code here is about to we don't need to change this that's what's all this issue here

212
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
Your filtering doesn't affect this whatever you grab you want these links on the page

213
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:04,991
So you could click to those areas right you want to have it ready to use

214
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:09,343
And then here's little tweak we made for the router

215
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:14,719
To identify the correct Elias

216
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:19,583
So we want to get the correct Elias in relation to

217
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
These different areas

218
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:27,775
So in this one we going to be in the Sermon we would be doing sermons here

219
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,055
So we could

220
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:32,127
Change this

221
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,663
S View

222
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:34,943
to

223
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Sermon

224
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Like that

225
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,903
Because we know

226
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,815
Oh wait a minute we don't we will be looking at a list of sermons

227
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Ok so that case

228
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
We not gonna be able to very effectively build a Elias

229
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,151
Because at the moment it used to be them the preachers name so that that would have been

230
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:11,551
Preacher in here this place holder would have been replaced with preacher now because we're not

231
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
going to be filtering by preacher or category we gonna end up having to just

232
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:21,535
Use the ID because there is

233
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
No identity if I could say there's no way to link the page to a specific identity

234
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:32,031
So what I would usually do in that case

235
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:33,567
I would just

236
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:37,407
Turn this off and see what is the default behaviour

237
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,711
What comes out ok

238
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
So let's walk through that and see how that works out for us

239
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:50,207
Ok so now we just gonna save as copy

240
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:56,607
That's we we gonna do leave the Pagination on because like I said you want to be able to return

241
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:00,447
Only at most 100 items per page

242
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
So save as copy

243
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
And close

244
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,407
So now we have a new

245
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:12,991
List query called sermons all

246
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,831
And it is ready to be used

247
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,695
And it basically only filters by access this is what I want and

248
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
That should do that should do it

249
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:26,815
Now let's go to our site views

250
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:30,655
We basically took this item

251
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,679
And

252
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
We changed it

253
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,543
Get That's what we did

254
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
Wait no not this one

255
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,407
This one

256
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Because

257
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,967
You see it has

258
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,343
A Preacher ID but it's actually having a list query for the sermons

259
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
And then it has

260
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:57,535
A bunch of custom gets to get the number of downloads the number of sermons and the actual

261
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,327
Preachers information

262
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:03,935
So we want to change this now this View

263
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,055
To actually just get all the sermons in the system right

264
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,639
The first thing will do is will change this

265
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,199
To this sermon all

266
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,479
Option

267
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,831
And will change this also do that to see how they will look

268
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:27,743
Basically looks exactly the same you see so that means we don't really need to change anything

269
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,583
Here all of this should still work

270
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,375
Just the way it was

271
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,215
If you want to do your own implementation here

272
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,519
Then you'll need to

273
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,055
Basically use

274
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,591
These values

275
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:46,431
to build your own implementation

276
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
I'm using

277
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
A lot of

278
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,063
Uikit

279
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:58,463
Classes here you see and in these templates this is also what's being

280
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,303
Done so we have many

281
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
Different implementations but now you see we have these params in here now

282
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
This params brings to us a certain values linked to the preacher page

283
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
But we are going to change this this is no longer going to be preacher because it can't have the

284
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:25,087
Same codes name of as another page

285
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
So we'll have to change this and

286
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,719
We gonna change this to all

287
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,303
Just like that

288
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,911
And change this to all so everywhere where we dealing with

289
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
params

290
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,543
We need to change the params so we can highlight them

291
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,103
And we need to change that

292
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,383
Because

293
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
We are changing this view

294
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
We calling it all

295
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:55,807
Ok

296
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:04,767
Like that

297
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Ok

298
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:22,431
Now this I'm going to call this sermon

299
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:26,527
we are working with sermons

300
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,319
So the context is sermon

301
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:34,207
Because if we check permissions everything you wanna check that against the sermon

302
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
Permission structure

303
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,279
So

304
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
I'm gonna use sermon there

305
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
And everywhere else I'm gonna just change this to all and remember this because we're gonna have

306
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
To go add a whole lot of new fields

307
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,383
To this component to have those values ok

308
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
So just keep that in mind

309
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,855
We need we need to have this extra switch

310
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,903
For the all display

311
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:04,927
All

312
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:08,255
Sermons display all sermons display

313
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,095
Now

314
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,447
Mind you this area shouldn't even be here now

315
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:21,311
Because we are not going to retrieve a Preacher information

316
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
So we taking that out

317
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,199
So we only want you all sermons all sermons

318
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,759
And then let's look at this

319
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
I'm thinking you you know I don't wanna get

320
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,647
Too complicated here

321
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,207
So let me change this

322
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,231
Back

323
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,143
It could work if we just leave it the way it was

324
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
But no, you know I started going down this way so let me show you what that mean

325
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:55,359
to add these values in

326
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:58,175
It's just that in our

327
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,527
Templates sermon table and sermon Grid And sermon list

328
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
Were also gonna have to look at some param values

329
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
And make some tweaks

330
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,183
So

331
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,231
When we need to take

332
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:14,559
Take basically copy these

333
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
Down somewhere

334
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:17,375
So we can

335
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
We can go look at them so it's that one

336
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
sermon list

337
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:31,967
sermon grid and table

338
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:40,415
Ok So those are the three areas we need to go look at

339
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,255
So let's do that now

340
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:49,119
Save as copy before we do it you want to check out some other things

341
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Ok

342
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:52,447
let's see

343
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,775
We have some colour settings here

344
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,103
This also be changed to all

345
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,247
So we just checking for these params right so we can

346
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,063
Update everything correctly

347
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,159
Now this

348
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,767
Is for hits

349
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,863
We're not gonna need the hits area

350
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
Because

351
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,215
When I do targeting a Preacher

352
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,775
So I'm going to take this out

353
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,055
We don't need this

354
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,175
That should be enough

355
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:37,247
Just check that it's not up here

356
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,135
Basically take that out as well

357
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:50,815
I had to take that out because it was calling that function hit

358
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Which was

359
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
In in this area here

360
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:58,495
But I took that out because we not getting a Preacher

361
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:02,847
So since we not getting a Preacher we don't need to increment the hit

362
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:07,967
Because we not counting anything so that's why I took that out

363
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:14,879
I'm here I'm doing some fooTable Styles this is still using an old version of fooTable

364
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
So

365
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
This might be a good time to update this but ok I don't have time now so I'm just gonna fall back

366
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376
To this for now

367
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,144
Ok

368
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
So here Everything looks fine

369
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,520
I'm gonna say save as copy

370
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:35,360
Close I did I do that already

371
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:39,200
No that was good ok so now we have a new

372
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
Site view

373
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:43,808
And we need to go look at these templates

374
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,112
So let's go out of here

375
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:47,904
Go to templates

376
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:52,000
So the templates we wanna look at it is these three

377
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,816
So it is first one

378
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:03,008
Sermons table it's this one here let's open that

379
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Ok

380
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:12,224
So now we'll see that we have again

381
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,016
A whole lot of

382
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
Params here

383
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
With

384
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,624
Placeholders

385
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:24,000
Site view site view site view so now we gonna have a problem

386
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:29,888
No not really because we are using all so this will update to all

387
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:36,288
Now I have to set this params for sermons

388
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,432
Description sermon preacher series category so all of these

389
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,760
Params which are actually fields

390
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:52,160
In the configuration of this component I have to update so this

391
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:58,560
SView will fall back to the view where this

392
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,912
Template is going to be used so that the site view

393
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,496
Which we working with its code name is all

394
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:08,288
So

395
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:11,360
It's going to fall back to the word

396
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
All

397
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,944
This is what it's going to fall back to

398
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:21,344
Ok so in that template everywhere you see S view it is

399
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,392
Going to be call all

400
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:28,768
So if we go to the sermons list same thing here

401
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,048
let's see

402
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,680
This seems fine

403
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
Hear this one

404
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,032
It's going to fall back to all

405
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Like that

406
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
So

407
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:49,248
We need to set a value for this and that will then decide what type of

408
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,528
List file

409
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,552
This will have

410
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
The same would go for the grid

411
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,648
If we opened preacher

412
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
not preacher, sermons grid

413
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,304
Here

414
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,864
We're again seeing

415
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,144
A lot of

416
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,960
Sview.....Sview

417
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,240
Values

418
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776
All over the place

419
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:14,592
And it is going to affect

420
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:20,736
The component if we don't set these

421
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,552
Parameters in the global settings

422
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,880
Then it won't find this but it will fall back to zero

423
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:34,048
So you'll still work but it won't load anything because zero means nul ok

424
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:38,656
So it will not load the preacher

425
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
Values

426
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:46,336
And that's why it might look like things are not working because these

427
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:49,920
Configuration values are not existing yet

428
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,736
We need to create them I'll show you how

429
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:59,648
I was hoping to skip that but I realize

430
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,464
It's a helpful thing to know how to do that

431
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
So

432
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,144
For now first step would be to add this

433
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
Site view

434
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:14,240
So I'm gonna just add a down here

435
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:20,640
Under before sermon I'm gonna say

436
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
All sermons

437
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:30,112
I'm gonna give it an add menu it has meta

438
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
Country that has access and it's public ok so

439
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
I'm adding it in there

440
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:40,864
To the components site views

441
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,264
Save and close so if I compile this now we will

442
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,664
Get that view added to the component and everything should be there so

443
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:56,736
Let's do that compile it quickly

444
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
Ok now I've got it installed

445
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,952
So we go here Sermon distributor

446
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,280
We have all our values here

447
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:14,656
We have no preachers or sermons or anything created

448
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:21,056
So we won't have a fully functional front end but if we go to menus

449
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
And we would to change our home

450
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
to

451
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,760
Sermons all sermons

452
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
Save and close

453
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
we'll go back to sermons

454
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,208
And options

455
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:43,072
Then to permissions and we search for

456
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:44,352
Site

457
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Then we see there is a site

458
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:53,568
All sermons access and it said to allow but sometimes if you're busy updating

459
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,896
It may not be set to allow so you must change that

460
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
for your public

461
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
And

462
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,784
Now if we go front end

463
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,832
OK, we have a error account

464
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,880
So let's look at that

465
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
That's on

466
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,768
View HTML 5

467
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:15,072
No ...HTML PHP

468
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,400
48 let's go look at that no sermons were found

469
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,240
So here

470
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:24,544
Our

471
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:29,152
line 48 in the sermons

472
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:30,432
Views all

473
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
Line 48 we have a number of sermons now since there is no number in

474
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
And the system

475
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,904
It's giving us an error

476
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:44,256
Let's so let's fix that that shouldn't be that hard to fix

477
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
We go back

478
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,888
To our component in Joomla

479
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
In the site views

480
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
We open all sermons

481
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Go to PHP

482
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,104
And

483
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,152
It's basically

484
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,760
This one here

485
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,576
So what we can do

486
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
As we can

487
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:13,184
do a little

488
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Check here

489
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
We say

490
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,448
Something like that we first check is it a array

491
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,752
And if it is then

492
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,592
We count the array because that's how many sermons they are

493
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,896
And we we added here

494
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
And then here we can just say

495
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
You know

496
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Nul

497
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
If there's none

498
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:44,160
Ok now we actually don't need these values anymore

499
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,464
Because we're not actually

500
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:52,608
Getting a Preacher ID and preacher ID so I'm gonna remove this as well

501
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,400
From from the component

502
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,216
Because we don't have a Preacher

503
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,240
In this

504
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
Return set

505
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,824
So we don't need those values

506
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,128
So I'm taking them out just

507
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,688
For good practice

508
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,504
And then that should then

509
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
Get us going

510
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,088
Let's compile it again

511
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,112
and install

512
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,952
Now we have is no sermons were found

513
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:25,120
We can go back to our component and we can add a few you know values

514
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,680
Ok so I've Now added

515
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:29,472
a whole lot of sermons

516
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,288
And just

517
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
Randomly

518
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
Sorted them

519
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
We should have enough to work with here

520
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,736
Let's see that's is about

521
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,320
About 400

522
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
400 sermons

523
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:49,440
Ok so now on the front

524
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
We gonna diss refresh the front page

525
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,328
And wallah

526
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,656
We now have all of these showing up

527
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:02,240
And it is all of the sermons

528
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,848
And there is going to that specific sermon

529
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,944
And then this specific

530
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
Series

531
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:18,112
And it's showing us the hits of every sermon

532
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
And

533
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,488
We can page to other pages

534
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:28,864
pagination we can change this to a greater amount

535
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,936
Click the wrong button here

536
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:34,496
Ok so now we have 100

537
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
Yeah so

538
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:42,176
Our new list is working as we expected

539
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:47,296
So but we still haven't set

540
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
The

541
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,624
The correct

542
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,976
Values here so let me show you what I mean

543
00:30:57,536 --> 00:31:01,376
In our display we have this all sermon table colour

544
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
And we have that set here

545
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,800
Then we have also

546
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:10,592
Some

547
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
If we open the

548
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,016
Default page we have this display

549
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
And

550
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
Yeah

551
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,648
So the first one

552
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:28,256
Although if it doesn't find one or two it defaults to list

553
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:33,632
So we don't have these values where are these values found

554
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,704
They are found in the components

555
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,752
Config

556
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,336
So if I go to the member of the administrative area

557
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,176
And I open the config.xml

558
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,272
Then those values should be in this file

559
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,064
This file

560
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,112
If we scroll down

561
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:58,464
We will see there sermon default icon

562
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
Box scroll down scroll down

563
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:08,192
Here's the preacher remember preacher display we change that to all display and

564
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
list style

565
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,312
Now so we see the Preacher's values are here

566
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
How did it get here

567
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:19,200
In component Builder

568
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
If I go back to component builder

569
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:26,368
There is an area called component config

570
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,416
If you open that

571
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:36,096
You'll find a whole lot of fields here

572
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
And

573
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:44,288
It's got tab names that bundle them so the series bundles all these

574
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
Values

575
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:48,384
So we'll have to

576
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:51,456
Go up all the way here

577
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:53,504
Two preachers

578
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,320
Actually preacher singular this one

579
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,720
And we'll have to go create each of these Fields except

580
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,744
These

581
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,816
Menu this one will have to do

582
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
This we won't

583
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:15,776
Because we not getting the preacher right so we just need to get the values that are related to the sermon

584
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,056
Layout

585
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,360
So it's from here

586
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:23,968
Basically from these values. We will need the

587
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,832
Will need to get it from after the spacer

588
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:36,512
Table grid list style colour icon description

589
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,072
Series

590
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,632
Category

591
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,936
Sermon counter

592
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
Hits

593
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:52,384
Downloads and a switch sermon preacher open so these are the

594
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,736
Fields we'll have to go and recreate

595
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:59,808
For the all view

596
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:03,648
So we can copy switch sermons

597
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
fords

598
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:08,768
Bracket preacher

599
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
And weekend

600
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:12,608
Search for this in the field area

601
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,936
Basically this string

602
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:18,496
just to be the same

603
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
As the one you see there

604
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,384
So we're going to fields

605
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:28,224
And we type in that string and search

606
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:34,624
And so here are all those values that we need to also create

607
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,000
So there are two ways to do this one is I can just copy them all

608
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
With this batch

609
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
Option

610
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,912
or the other is to do them one at a time

611
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
So I'm gonna do them

612
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,544
Just let's just do at least one

613
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:58,176
So I need to change a few values here I need to change this to all

614
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,504
I need to change that to all

615
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,320
And

616
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,904
This as well all

617
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,768
All

618
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,840
Table grid list

619
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
the default is grid

620
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
That's 2

621
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:23,264
Ok so that is the first one I'm gonna save as copy

622
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,336
And then

623
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Close

624
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,664
Now the second one

625
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:32,480
And So It Goes On

626
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,272
I need to

627
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
Convert these fields

628
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
For the all view

629
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:44,512
We can leave this to be sermons

630
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:50,144
Set if sermon hits to be shown should be staying that's right that's right this would be all hits that

631
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,424
And then

632
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,728
Save as copy

633
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Close

634
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:58,080
Now description

635
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
All

636
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,992
Show sermon description

637
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:08,064
This would be fine fine that must be all

638
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,600
we change that to

639
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
all

640
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,416
Save as copy

641
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,000
I think that's more than enough

642
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:20,352
Now we go back to the component and to the config area

643
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
And then underneath

644
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
The

645
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,616
I think I'm gonna do it here

646
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,688
Before sermon

647
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
Right here

648
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,760
Just add a few

649
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,784
Fields

650
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,160
So it should be marked as Global we gonna change this to all

651
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:46,976
All

652
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,376
And then

653
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:56,448
We'll just search for it

654
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,984
I will use the

655
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,264
The grid

656
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
And the hits

657
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,152
And the description I'm just gonna do those 3

658
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:07,712
So we are doing that for all

659
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
The table the hits the description

660
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
Save and close

661
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,160
And can compile and install

662
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:20,768
Now when we opened sermon distributor backend we go to options

663
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
We'll now I have a new tab you're called all

664
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:30,752
And we can change this to table grid or List.  It is already on list so let's let's change it

665
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
to table

666
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,128
Let's say don't show hits and don't show description

667
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,664
And save

668
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,200
This value

669
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,320
So it is loading it correctly now

670
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,600
As a table

671
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:48,672
Now let's make another change here

672
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
let's

673
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:55,072
Let's say show hits and show description and let's make it a grid and save

674
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,704
Now we refresh it

675
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,240
And there we go

676
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
We have it all now in gridlayout

677
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,360
Now it's again

678
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
Just giving us

679
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
The last hundred

680
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
And we can

681
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
paginate through them

682
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
Correctly

683
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
So it's it's falling Back To The Way It Used To Work except that it doesn't show the 

684
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
actual

685
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,560
It's not

686
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,424
Filtering it by preacher it just grabbing all of the values

687
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:34,752
Ok I think that's all for now

688
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,080
To show you how to

689
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:41,408
Load a a list of values

690
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,200
in JCB

691
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:48,576
With pagination without any filter like

692
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:50,112
For example preacher

693
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:52,672
Ok well thanks for watching
