00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,144
At last we are happy to announce that we have added Joomla custom field integration

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,824
Joomla custom fields are the these Fields that you see on the users it's like there's Fields here in

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,592
Field groups

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,896
And the same under articles

5
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,432
Fields and field groups

6
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:19,968
Which basically

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:23,552
Targets the articles all the users respectively

8
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:27,392
If you add fields on the articles when you create an article

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:29,184
And it

10
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:35,584
Meets the specific criteria the field show up and you fill them in it shows up on the front end of your website

11
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Now

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,704
That whole field and field group

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,592
Concept has a Integrative option for third-party components

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,968
So we have now changed JCB enough to

15
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,552
Allow that kind of field integration in your

16
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:57,088
components

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,696
And all I'm gonna do now it's just demonstrate how to make use of this

18
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
So we'll just use the normal demo component

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,400
Basically the way to add the fields to your demo component

20
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:12,448
Is to actually

21
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,776
You have admin views

22
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
And you gonna actually link the field to a admin view you can link it to multiple Admin Views

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:28,832
But I'm gonna demonstrate linking it to only this one called look

24
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,392
As you click on this edit here

25
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,464
And basically go to the area where you

26
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,304
Link the look the view to the component

27
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,656
And you see there's know new field called Joomla fields

28
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,520
Select if the option to add Joomla Fields should be added

29
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:52,128
To the view so we we just gonna click that that's really all you need to do

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,944
To get it working in a backend

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
The front end that's got little bit more

32
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
you know tricks to it

33
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,648
And that is to be expected because the front end of JCB components

34
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
Should be unique

35
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,256
And that's well that was the approach

36
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:13,632
So we gonna close out of this and before making any changes to the front end of the

37
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Component I'm just gonna compile this

38
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,520
And install it on to this current website to see what happened

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,408
So we got compiler here when I just compile our

40
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Component

41
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
And install it

42
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Quite simple

43
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,064
And then we going to open

44
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
The component here

45
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,160
And when we go to looks

46
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:41,024
We'll see there are now looks Fields and looks Fields groups

47
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,352
So I'm gonna create a group here quickly say new

48
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
And say

49
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216
Let's say

50
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,288
Really Easy and save and close

51
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:56,896
So we got this group called Really Easy I'm gonna now creative a field

52
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:00,736
And we gonna just make it a text field in call it

53
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
simple field and

54
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:05,600
We gonna add it to Really Easy group

55
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:06,880
save and close

56
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
here we got a field

57
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
If we now go to looks

58
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
And click on new

59
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:16,096
Will see that it has a new tab here called Really Easy

60
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,168
And we can click there and it's got a simple field

61
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
So we can say there

62
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
The name and

63
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
For the field you also give it a value

64
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,408
Just call at input value

65
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,200
And save and close

66
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
And immediately

67
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:39,648
You have the input value stored you got the name and well everything works exactly as expected

68
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
So it's created a tab

69
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,000
And if you've added a field

70
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,280
you can

71
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,096
Actually add More Fields to this tab

72
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Simply

73
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:55,264
By selecting the same group call it More fields save and close

74
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,056
and we got More Fields

75
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,104
You going back to the look

76
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,384
And open it

77
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
You'll see that now More Fields was also showing up

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,760
With more input

79
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
And

80
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:12,160
That's how the custom field concept works

81
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
 that's the easy part basically adding it to the component now like I said before you could add

82
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,351
it per admin View

83
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:22,911
But usually you would have one View

84
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,191
Where you at this

85
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:28,799
Now in the front end of this component you need to do a little bit more

86
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,127
Because the way that the fields work

87
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Is explained

88
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,967
As triggering

89
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,527
On specific events

90
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
On the front end of the component

91
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,903
Now we at JCB have

92
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,207
Also added the option to

93
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
Add these events to your site views

94
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,839
But it's a little bit hidden and

95
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:58,239
Purposefully that way because we added it to the dynamic get area and not the site view

96
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,007
Area

97
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
And it is because

98
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
The dynamic Get

99
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:06,431
Is targeting either multiple items or

100
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,247
Single items and the events are really

101
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,111
Actually for single items so it seemed right that we added there

102
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,671
To easily validate and so forth anyway

103
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,719
So let's do that

104
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,767
It go to component

105
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:21,535
Builder

106
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:25,631
JCB and go to your custom or your dynamic gets

107
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,447
Now we we wanna add it to the looks

108
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
Sorry to the looking because it's a get item

109
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,823
Get so will open this

110
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:38,175
You see that now there is this new content plugin events

111
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
Which you can select

112
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,503
now 

113
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,343
The fields if we go back to the fields area

114
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
And you open the fields

115
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,863
You see that it has options

116
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,191
And it here got automatic display option

117
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,055
So before display after display after title

118
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,359
And do not automatically display

119
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,895
These options

120
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
Is what is used

121
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,783
To Actually display the values that's submitted it to his field

122
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:16,831
On the front end of the site

123
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,719
So basically you've got before display after display and do not automatic display

124
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,511
And even after title

125
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Now

126
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:30,911
By Default it is before display but you can obviously change that

127
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,191
In the

128
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,239
So you need in your component

129
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,519
To Target

130
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,799
These

131
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Four events

132
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:41,151
For the user to make use of these fields

133
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
 they might decide now they want to

134
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,759
Just use the fields in a back end

135
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:50,111
And it will basically be related on to this show on

136
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,415
If you do that

137
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,207
it will not even show on the back

138
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,487
So

139
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Yeah this is

140
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
This is sort of it's Integrative

141
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Switches

142
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:01,375
But

143
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:03,679
You need to Target these switches

144
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:07,519
Only in Your custom code on the front

145
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:08,799
At this point

146
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:12,639
And it's not really that hard to do that I'll show you why

147
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,967
So back into the dynamic Get I'm gonna

148
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
basically add title 

149
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:22,367
 add before display and add after display as events

150
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,903
And save and close

151
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,719
Now that will just

152
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767
Practicly put the code

153
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
Into your component

154
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
So let me first show you the code how it looks now

155
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
So the component folder root folder I'm going to components and then I'm gonna go to demo

156
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,895
And basically go to views

157
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
And

158
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,991
then open looking

159
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,831
And then this view HTML.PHP file

160
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,879
Now the events

161
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:56,415
Are going to be added

162
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:58,207
To the display function

163
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
So currently as you can see

164
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
There's nothing here

165
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:05,119
So we gonna compile the component and see what changes

166
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:10,751
So just recap I've just added the events to the dynamic get

167
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,543
I'm going to the compiler

168
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
And I'm gonna recompile the 

169
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Component and install it

170
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
To see

171
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:22,527
What those events, you know the changes , how they will change the code

172
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
So it's

173
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
OK we'll

174
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Go here

175
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,183
If we scroll down now

176
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:33,535
Will see that it added the dispatcher to the display

177
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
And

178
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
Down here

179
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,887
It imports the

180
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
Content plugin now

181
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,239
it creates in the item

182
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:45,311
Object it creates a new

183
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
Object called event

184
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,895
And then

185
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:53,247
Basically it checks whether your item has parameters

186
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,807
So it checks is there any parameters

187
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
Been passed

188
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,671
That is in your Dynamic get you could grab the params

189
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,463
 column

190
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
From your

191
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
Items

192
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
And it's basically checking is it there

193
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
If it's not there

194
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
it going to fall back

195
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:13,215
Onto the Globals

196
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,495
So if it's there

197
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:16,543
And if it's a Json it will

198
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Basically convert it to an array

199
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
And had it there or

200
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:23,199
it will fall back to the global params

201
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,759
And then

202
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,551
It is going to trigger

203
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,855
The on after title and

204
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
On content before display

205
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,719
And on content after display

206
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
And

207
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:38,047
It's gonna pass the components

208
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:38,815
Name

209
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
And the actual View

210
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,911
Value here

211
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
But now

212
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,983
We know

213
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
That

214
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:49,567
This is basically setting the context

215
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,359
Of this

216
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,639
Event

217
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:55,199
Now you could be building a plug in

218
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,015
That is actually targeting look

219
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,295
And not looking

220
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:01,343
And you want

221
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:05,183
To change the context of this specific

222
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,207
Event that

223
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,255
Has been passed over here

224
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,583
And to do that we've also added a context

225
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,143
Field in the site view

226
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,447
So your site view can

227
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,239
Change its context

228
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,287
So let me show you

229
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,359
So we'll just open the site views

230
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:28,479
And in the site views we have that view called looking we can open that

231
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
And here we now have a new

232
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,319
Field called context

233
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,903
So we have looking selected here as our dynamic get

234
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
And here we can set the contacts

235
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
To suit

236
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
The Dynamic get

237
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:45,119
And not fall back to the main code

238
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,727
If you don't add this context it will fall back to this code Name

239
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,287
But you could say I want the context to be look

240
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:53,823
And not looking

241
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,919
And then save and close and if we compile this again

242
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
It will actually update the contexts

243
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
Of that specific event

244
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,087
And any other event related to that

245
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,647
Will do that get

246
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:12,767
And which is really what you want so now you'll see it's changed it to look

247
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:17,887
So it's still past the component's name but the correct context

248
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:19,935
In relation to your event

249
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,519
And now what's gonna happen

250
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,103
Why we want this to be look

251
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
It's because

252
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,407
....

253
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,455
....

254
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,319
The fields are linked to the look

255
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
View the look admin view

256
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:40,415
And

257
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:46,815
So it is stored in the database under this context and not under the context of looking

258
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,679
But you are basically having both here on the front

259
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:56,031
So you couldn't use the name and look again you had to use another name

260
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,823
And so the way too then

261
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
Actually get that same context called on your title and is to actually change it like I've just done

262
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
I know that's a lot of

263
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
Explanation

264
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
Maybe some of you don't even understand

265
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
What I've just said but

266
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,975
Those who do will know I'll get this is nice you can

267
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
Change the context

268
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Through the site view

269
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
So that you could have the same context be triggered

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,399
Multiple times

271
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
As you would have it

272
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,007
It's a little bit of a

273
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:30,847
Tweak at the moment we might bring more Automation in

274
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,687
But I know it is actually a little liberating so you could

275
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:37,247
Really be free and how you want to do this

276
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551
But what now is going to happen

277
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:44,415
Is these events are being triggered and the values are being stored

278
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
Here

279
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
So whatever gets thrown back from the plugins

280
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,327
Gets placed into this value here

281
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:55,679
I'm so the only custom code that you now Actually need to do

282
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
After

283
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:03,615
Fixing up the events being added to the dynamic get and then updating the context to 

284
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,639
Target the corrected

285
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,479
View , now just again I'll show you just once again

286
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Why

287
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:11,039
Do I want this to be look

288
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
If we go to our

289
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:14,623
 admin View

290
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
We'll see we'll see

291
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,695
That

292
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,743
If you open looks

293
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
And then click here

294
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,327
You see hear the top

295
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,143
It says demo and the view

296
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:27,423
Is look

297
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
And so

298
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,519
The context of these fields

299
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,335
Are linked to that value

300
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,383
And that value

301
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,199
So this one is always gonna be correct

302
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
But this one could be different

303
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:45,599
And so you need to in your site view make sure that your targeting

304
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,623
The correct

305
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:49,951
Context of where these fields are

306
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
So you be passing basically the ID

307
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:58,143
And this context and Joomla will automatically retrieve the values of this fields

308
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
And place those values

309
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
For you

310
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,031
Inside of this

311
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
Object here or actually

312
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,919
It will create a string as you see you here it implodes the array

313
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,199
Into string

314
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,991
And places it in here

315
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:15,807
So all you now would need to do

316
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,927
Is basically echo out Those values in any way you want them to look

317
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,463
So you could

318
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:24,767
Yeah you could add it in some diff tags

319
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,047
And 

320
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,631
 I'll show you that in a moment

321
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,167
So for now

322
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,727
All I wanted to explain is how these events

323
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
Actually get the

324
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,567
Field values on the page

325
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,615
So those field values are

326
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:45,247
Loaded into these values respectively of its switches

327
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,087
Which I showed you earlier in setting up the field

328
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,463
Now the Joomla web site currently is not set up to show the looks

329
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,511
So we gonna go to the menu

330
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,047
And change that

331
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:59,583
Going to main menu

332
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,911
And I'm going to click here on home

333
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,471
And I'm gonna select

334
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,055
Let's see where is a demo

335
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Looks

336
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
And

337
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Yeah that's basically it

338
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:17,247
And gonna save and close out of that

339
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:19,551
So now we have looks

340
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,087
On the

341
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
The page

342
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,159
The default page of the website

343
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,207
If we click here it should load

344
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:29,023
And there it is the name

345
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,119
To see a list of looks and here's the name if you click on that

346
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,167
It shows us the name

347
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,031
And it shows as there's been one head and if we refresh that it shows two heads

348
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
So

349
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
That all works well

350
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,943
But our custom values which we have submitted

351
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Is not showing up

352
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
So

353
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
This

354
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:54,111
 value is showing up and even we could add some

355
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Description

356
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
And

357
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,583
This is

358
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:07,935
Also going to show up if we refresh the page here

359
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:11,519
there's the description and we click here there is the description

360
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:16,639
So all that is showing up but the real easy values are not showing up

361
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,735
And we want them to also be showing up on the page

362
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:24,063
And That's what we are going to do

363
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
For them

364
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:28,159
By Simply using those

365
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Event

366
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Objects

367
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,791
So over here we have

368
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
The

369
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:39,423
Content after display content before display and content after

370
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,215
 title

371
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Now

372
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,775
If you forget

373
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,615
How to use this or how to place this

374
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
The component that you can go to his this content

375
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Component

376
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,527

00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,599
View

379
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:02,207
And you would see something very similar scroll down down down here

380
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,047
You see something well unless they've changed it by the time

381
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
But at this time

382
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,167
The default of Joomla's implementation is very much the same

383
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:17,823
So it's also triggering the content and it's also placing it into these values which means that

384
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,615
That if you go to it's template

385
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,663
Default PHP

386
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
You will see

387
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,551
Places basically you could search for it so you could take this

388
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,343
After title

389
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,367
Copy that

390
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
Come over here

391
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,487
And place it in there and here you see

392
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,511
Basically

393
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,607
The content is generated by the content plugin event on

394
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,167
And it basically just Echoes it out

395
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:49,567
So you could use this code just like that copy paste it into your component

396
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,359
After the title

397
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,687
And the same goes with the other events

398
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,783
So with the before display and after display

399
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:05,183
So let me do that quickly I'm gonna just grab these and place them into our component

400
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:12,095
So I've just copied them to a notepad like that I'm gonna move them to my other screen

401
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,423
And then I'm gonna go back to to JCB

402
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
And

403
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Go to my component

404
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,103
The site view of a component

405
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,407
And I'm going to open looking

406
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
And in the component

407
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,527
We have a whole lot of things happening here

408
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:36,927
Basically we

409
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
have a article

410
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:39,743
Comment here

411
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:42,303
And over here is the title

412
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,095
So we want

413
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
We want that

414
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:46,655
Value

415
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,959
To actually echo out

416
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,495
After the title

417
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
So

418
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
We gonna take

419
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,591
That first one

420
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,919
Which is the event after the title

421
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
I'm gonna place it

422
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
Between the header and this diff

423
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,551
Here

424
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
So

425
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,855
Basically

426
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,463
There

427
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,887
So that the content is generated by there and it's on content after title so this is the title

428
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
And then when is gonna show over here

429
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,287
Then we have another one on content before display

430
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
Have the content before display

431
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:32,479
 I would like to think it needs to go first before anything

432
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,295
So I wanna put that there

433
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,599
On before anything displays

434
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,879
That's way at the top

435
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,951
And with content after display

436
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,535
I  wanna put that obviously at the very end

437
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,071
Below everything

438
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:49,119
So that's quite simple

439
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:53,215
We could do more we could wrap it in a diff we could

440
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
Do all kinds of styles to it

441
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
But that's the simplest way and I'm just gonna demonstrate that

442
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
Save and close here

443
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
And then basically compile it again

444
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,271
Install

445
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,879
And now let's go refresh that page

446
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Oops I got some errors here

447
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:16,767
I realised

448
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,863
I'm using slightly different names then

449
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,655
The ones I copied from the content

450
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,703
You know the article area

451
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Content area

452
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,263
 let me show you that

453
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,311
So

454
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:35,711
They are saying up here in the comment on content before display and here it's before display content

455
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
 it's like a little bit

456
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
Different

457
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
So I'm using exactly the same

458
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,391
So just

459
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Heads Up

460
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
Use the the same as

461
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:49,023
What is here in a comment

462
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
And that's little me that

463
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
 always trying to

464
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Keep everything the same

465
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215
We save that it should work now

466
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,615
So here we go simple Fields input value more fields with more input

467
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,687
There are those values displayed on the front

468
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
So if we go back here

469
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
We can close this out

470
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:14,623
Go back to the fields and let's say with a more fields

471
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:19,232
You wanna change that to display after the title

472
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,256
Save

473
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,096
And then go back to the front and refresh this

474
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,448
So now the one is up here and the other one is after the title

475
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,336
So let's say we want simple field to actually show at the very end of our value

476
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:37,408
go out of more Fields into simple field

477
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,200
I will change that

478
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
to

479
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
you know

480
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:43,808
After display

481
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:45,344
Save and close

482
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,648
So you could move the values

483
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,672
Position

484
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:54,560
Simply and everyone will move now you see that simple Field is below everything

485
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,864
And if you realise 

486
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,168
This whole area here is the block

487
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,824
So that's how the custom Fields can come to the front you can also say you know I don't want this

488
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Area to show up

489
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
And you can go to

490
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
To the field simple field

491
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,272
And you could say show label hide label

492
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,552
And save

493
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,392
And now if you refresh it will only give you the value

494
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
So

495
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,488
That's the kind of behavioral integration

496
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
So that's a quick demonstration

497
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:30,912
Of how to now use Joomla custom fields in your components

498
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
And how to then

499
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:36,288
Model those values into the front end

500
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:40,896
By Simply making use of the events

501
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
And

502
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
Wow have fun I'm sure this will 

503
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
Make things even more interesting

504
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,600
Thanks for watching
