1
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:13,568
Person could use in trying to create extensions

2
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:19,968
My name is Marco Dings you can interact on social media with any of these

3
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:24,064
items since I've got a lot sites.  I'm not going to read them out

4
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
Interact here

5
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:33,536
So I'm gonna tell a bit of what's out there because there's more solutions out there than Joomla Component

6
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
Builder why use a tool and then I'm focusing on the Joomla component builder itself and

7
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:44,288
We'll have a nice giveaway at the end of the session

8
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:47,360
So why use a tool at all

9
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,664
What's out there?

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,064
We have Component Creator I think that's a about it well-known extension by RST Joomla

11
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,208
sermon it's SAAS solution it's closed source

12
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,072
It's free for one table you have to pay subscription

13
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,472
Well you do get provisional support.  This is a wonderful too that's been

14
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
Presented on JAP since 2015 or even earlier JoomDD

15
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,200
Which is actually a model driven

16
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Tools or it actually abstracts your ideas and then generates a code out of it meaning you could

17
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
A theory create a Joomla a Drupal or a WordPress website go

18
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
forward if that's nice plugins for please in store many clips if you gave it a stuff and

19
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Now I also has a web editor it has some basic reverse engineering starts

20
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Theoretically you theoretically you can feed it any extension and it should be able to make model of them

21
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
I emphasize the theoretical part because I think that's quite some limitations for that to actually work

22
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
What is open source so the instinct developers are the back of the room and

23
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,096
You can't travel back in time but you could have seen their session

24
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
And is this Joomla component Builder a very unknown

25
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
Tool

26
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:26,432
What it has its own characteristics Joomla component builder is a component that you logged

27
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:27,456
Into your website

28
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,368
It actually is on your platform it builds the component for your

29
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,768
You in your plat form so you don't you're not dependent on any SAAS Solution whatsoever

30
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:46,912
And the tools was actually used to build itself

31
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
So the model that is used as they refer to themselves as the mapped

32
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:59,200
Joomla component that's where the you have the gooey interaction and stuff that

33
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
Used to generate its own coat

34
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,952
The compiled source is open source

35
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:14,560
So the mapped Component isn't but it's gonna change however

36
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:19,936
Even at this point in time there is no licence costs and are no limitations

37
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:26,336
So as component creator allows you to create a component based on one table yeah you can't do

38
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,384
very much with that

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
There still doesn't have any

40
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
Any limitations

41
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
So

42
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,576
Let me start by

43
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,160
Asking you what are the challenges that you see when you

44
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,792
Let we for start with the question who creates components or has created their own components in the past

45
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
Ok that's quite a lot of

46
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:53,728
People so what are the challenges that you'd see

47
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
In

48
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,896
That's so let me start with my esteemed colleagues Eve and Victor who I specially want to thank

49
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
For attending for the promise to do that so Eve what challenges

50
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:10,112
do you see when you create a new component

51
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:17,536
Well nothing

52
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,055
Yeah

53
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:33,151
And you're not lazy you want to

54
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,431
get

55
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
Rid of that of that repetition.  Let's say yes.

56
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
Ok

57
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:45,183
Everybody as a remark that people thank you very much thank you thank you

58
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
Anybody else want to add something. If sometimes if you change a name or something

59
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
Where it is their and their and their you have to correct them yeah

60
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:04,383
and does it that changes because of things that you do yourself ours changes that it's done by Joomla. no the change you do by yourself

61
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,623
Whatever it does

62
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,951
I should Change to this and then have to change it everywhere

63
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
Anybody want to add something. Rene. It is big the way components actually hold together

64
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Yes.  You can get lost you know.

65
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:31,007
Yeah

66
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,127
you can really quickly create a basic component

67
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,199
but if you want to do something special and you can't do it with these component creators. You can't load it back to your component field.

68
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,951
Ok ok have summarize some of the

69
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:56,351
Things that I think annoy me and doing that stuff that's a boilerplating

70
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
that is Specially what Eve was referring to setting up the directory structure creating all the crop files now

71
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
there is tools that will help you with that beach be storm but still it's tedious work and you have to watch the

72
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:14,271
Capitalisation of the names and the slots of naming conventions

73
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,319
And really I'm lazy

74
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927
And you think that a tool can do for me I'm very happy with

75
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
I also like

76
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
to reuse stuff

77
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:32,447
Obviously if you've already create a lot of extensions then you can reuse previous word back copy pasting

78
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,215
But

79
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
Yeah you want to rename it so there's some work involved you might want to reuse

80
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Other people's work

81
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
Maybe somebody created something nice and we use that and obviously use libraries in general

82
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:49,087
that contain

83
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,367
abstract stuff

84
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
There's a lot of stuff in Joomla that we all

85
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,071
Love I think

86
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,375
But you still have to do some stuff

87
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,031
By yourself and your own component if you want to have away make that work being multilingual

88
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Support

89
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Having from of groups

90
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,663
Access control structure

91
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,735
Adding history to your

92
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:22,367
Components use just as with article so that you can see you who changed what and what time

93
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,183
Custom fields

94
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,143
And not all tools support that and obviously the tools out there have their limitations either be it cost

95
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,239
Be it the licensing scheme

96
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,567
Or be it the skills required

97
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:44,127
And

98
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,759
Advanced items I would say ok can you extend that tool

99
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,295
Easily to

100
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,343
Accommodate new features

101
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:57,439
So should that be a

102
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,999
Workflow extension to Joomla

103
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095
How is it can you add up to your own component

104
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:07,167
Tools should in theory be able to

105
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
Add that without bothering you with

106
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
all the

107
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
nitty gritty details

108
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,151
Can you do reverse engineering JoomDD is a tool that can do that

109
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
Impart so that's ok

110
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,247
But

111
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:26,623
To me more importantly is the roundtrip development which Rene mentioned

112
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:33,279
Typically in the tool when you start you have their school while you can easily click together a table and view and stuff like that

113
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,119
You exported to got your component then you start working on it

114
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:42,495
As soon as you realize that you missed a field or what else something you're screwed

115
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,359
because you can't go back to that nice graphical model then you have to delve into it

116
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:49,663
Round trip development is something

117
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,479
That I value

118
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,831
Collaborative development

119
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Working together on a single component with multiple people and that say model

120
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,047
Those were things that I would like to see

121
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
In a tool that supports my workflow

122
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,447
Hans income

123
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Joomla component Builder

124
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,543
And specifically

125
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,847
Version 297 that's the

126
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:21,407
Latest and current version

127
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:26,015
So anything I'm telling will projected this version not the earlier version so

128
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,343
If you want to check it out check this version out that's the latest

129
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
basically gather a little more

130
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,535
So there is this

131
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:41,631
Link Joomla component builder on www.vdm.io well

132
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:46,239
Since this presentation will be available you will not need to copy it all

133
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
It's only extensions directory

134
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:51,103
Unfortunately in this talk

135
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
We can but scratch

136
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
The surface so what I ought to

137
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,015
Convey in the stork is

138
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:04,671
that I thatch on the ideas. He say oh yeah if you could do that that will be fine still you would need to delve in

139
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
To this

140
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:07,231
yourself

141
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,535
To get into the details

142
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,815
fortunately there's

143
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
Quite some

144
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
Documentation in the form of videos

145
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,007
Dozen

146
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,311
Dozen and dozen of hours of video

147
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
Which doesn't make for the easiest in

148
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:32,063
Looking up stuff but it does makes easy viewing just sitting in your own couch and streaming YouTube

149
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,111
Videos to your TV on

150
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Suck it in

151
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,839
Yeah we can but scratch the surface so you would really need to have a deeper look afterwards to see

152
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:49,727
How to do stuff but if resonate with you in what you can do because

153
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,287
Hope to convey that at least

154
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,103
Then you're in for a real treat

155
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,919
Let me go back

156
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:58,687
Because

157
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,063
Contact why I started this is because my son wanted to have a website

158
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:06,879
And children are like any customers

159
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
It's really easy

160
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:13,023
Nothing complex I just want

161
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:20,191
And this case he wants to wanted to create a website with Disney characters and the autographs and stuff like that

162
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,215
That's all he wanted

163
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:22,495
Well

164
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,287
Easy will do that with

165
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Fields custom fields

166
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:34,015
but 2 days in and require but I want to list and parades and I want to do this and I want to do that

167
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:40,159
Not gonna happen so I introduce them to this

168
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Tool

169
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
And

170
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:49,119
He made it happen and he was able while he's not dumb for her is actually quite intelligent so

171
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,935
What is not a diehard programmer

172
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:56,031
Body could make it happen with some out now I must say that

173
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:57,567
When we started

174
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Yeah they were weren't

175
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:07,295
The number of resources were limited to help us so there were a few videos

176
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
but something were unclear

177
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,879
Over the last few months

178
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,463
I've been an extensive contact with a developer Llewelyn

179
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,023
And over the months he

180
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,119
Opened up to the idea of a number of challenges that we see

181
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,959
And you will see in the giveaways at the end what that

182
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
the result of them

183
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,567
And that will actually really help you in

184
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:30,847
Getting started

185
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:34,687
So If you look at

186
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:39,551
Joomla computer builder I think the first thing that you will see is the dashboard

187
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,671
but control panel

188
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,231
Wiki

189
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,791
Notice board

190
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
has some marketing links

191
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
But most importantly for you that says Wiki

192
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
With

193
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Yeah you find in

194
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,055
Find all the tutorials all the

195
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,431
Links to the YouTube videos so once you install the component Builder

196
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
You'll got access to that to that just by looking at

197
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,551
The wiki

198
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:16,927
So unfortunately it's there is a explicit link obviously because it's

199
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,791
Yeah it's part of open source

200
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:27,935
unfortunately is not structured in terms of technical documentation whilst the

201
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
Videos are indexed in terms of time stands and say he is talking about this here talking about that

202
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Still it's

203
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,687
search ability is limited

204
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,015
There's a forum on the way you can do

205
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
Crash on answers

206
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:52,767
And there's obviously you can directly access that list of videos to YouTube channel to look at

207
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Stuff

208
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:01,215
So if you look at the WiKi that some general planning and you will hit this is a sample of the

209
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:07,871
Video on field types it's ok one minute and 5 we're talking about create field types

210
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,711
at one minute 57 is list view

211
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,015
It helps but it's not

212
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,295
Perfect

213
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,367
So let's not talk about

214
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,927
The work for what does it take

215
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,255
And what's possible in creating component

216
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,327
I've put together this

217
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
Diagram which is simplified

218
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:37,311
These are the topics we are called to touch upon so we have to add the components that's the stuff that you want to build yourself

219
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,151
The field types fields

220
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:45,759
We have bespokel that's really custom code to yourself

221
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:49,599
We have a dynamic get the view list view item view custom view.

222
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:53,439
Stuff that has to do with interacting with the data

223
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Of your model controller

224
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,815
Salivary some graphical stuff

225
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,887
I will touch on each of these items

226
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,519
Let's starts on the components first I've applicated

227
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
the diagram

228
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
So this is what you see when you

229
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,431
Look and added a

230
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
Component

231
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:24,671
These are the tabs you have we'll cycle through and so well your details tab where you can setup

232
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
The name the first name

233
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,327
Do stuff with debugging line numbers yeah anything

234
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,399
really you related to a

235
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Component

236
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
We have a settings manual

237
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:43,359
Why you can configure that thing more in depth

238
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:49,759
You see the list the reference to the administrator views the site views

239
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
custom admin views

240
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:54,111
I'll deal with it later

241
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
Libraries and helpers

242
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:02,047
The dashboard where you can create a custom dashboard for your extension with icons and stuff like that

243
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,839
MySQL data

244
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,399
The ReadMe file which is readme that gets

245
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,191
Exported with your

246
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,751
Extension

247
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,943
And as Dynamic integration after

248
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,991
Last part of the

249
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,295
Presentation

250
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,391
So

251
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,951
How do we build a component

252
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
The component

253
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:36,095
How Michael come as a surprise we have field types

254
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,399
I we have

255
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,423
Fields

256
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:44,287
So field types so basically the things that we know a lot from Joomla

257
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:48,639
There's a calendar category checkbox check boxes colour

258
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:54,015
Anything like that so That's the extra definition of something that you would want to

259
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:54,783
Create

260
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,575
You could

261
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Add your own

262
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:00,415
Filter type to that

263
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:03,231
These types

264
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,815
And those are the fields are share between all your

265
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Components

266
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,471
So you don't that's where you get part of the reuse of

267
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:19,615
You create a month and then if you've got a very specific field for a specific action

268
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:24,735
Some kind of zip codes address validator thingee

269
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
you create it here

270
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,623
And then you can setup

271
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Fields and

272
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:39,327
So are the institutions of field types

273
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,775
You can create your own Fields you can paste special fields with dedicated validation

274
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:50,079
Stuff like that and the fields are the stuff that

275
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,639
Eventually will end up in the database

276
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
in the tables

277
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
Probably unto now nothing is stored it

278
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
it's just abstract

279
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,927
You can set up your bespoke Fields so stuff that you

280
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:11,327
Like yourselves so there is the type value let it has can assign items

281
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:13,631
And as you can info here

282
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,935
You can have a lot of attributes to

283
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
And if you just about anything that you would

284
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
Like

285
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
You can add extra properties

286
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,455
Here

287
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:28,735
you can

288
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
here you see

289
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:36,159
And That's what we coming to where this is in this field in which views

290
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
It's used

291
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:43,327
So it is an admin view series in admin view preacher and admin view sermons

292
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,655
That's of the installed applications that I have

293
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,519
and here is Information on the

294
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:55,103
Attributes used to filter so there's a lot of stuff

295
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,919
That you can configure per field type

296
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
To set it up

297
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,367
Here in the bottom on the right corner we gonna saw

298
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
The views it was used in and

299
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:12,767
That's where it gets tangible so once you set up your field types

300
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
and your fields

301
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:19,167
If you at least need new ones that are not default with the tool

302
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,311
You're gonna set up your views and I think you're familiar with the list views and the item views

303
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:29,919
so the List views is where you got your tabular tabular display of multiple items

304
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:32,479
and your items used a typical

305
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,527
View of one of those

306
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,599
Items so that's the item View

307
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,439
Component

308
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
Builder it uses also a custom View

309
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:51,679
Which is used to like for reporting where you can do graphing or anything special that's not

310
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,983
Necessarily in the realm of a

311
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:55,007
Item view

312
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,799
Itself or list view

313
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:02,687
So these fields are the stuff that's gonna get

314
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,991
Added to the database

315
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,087
You can add all kinds of conditions in the view

316
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,623
For that

317
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,439
You can add buttons to a view

318
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,511
Not necessarily understand what is saved I commit or

319
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
Any other actions

320
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:25,471
And there's a plethora of options to hook into your

321
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:26,751
Code so

322
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,079
Adding an Ajax

323
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:32,127
called

324
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:38,527
PHP that's run on the get item so when you get a singular item

325
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,903
At the PHP for batch add PHP for

326
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,207
After publishing

327
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,255
Before deleting

328
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:50,303
Post save well

329
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:54,399
For the list query so you could 

330
00:20:56,447 --> 00:21:00,031
Read data from the database and manipulate it

331
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:02,847
Too show it in the different forms or if you have

332
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:09,247
Like numeric presentation of whatever attribute you could change that then to display as and item or

333
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,807
What you would wish

334
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,343
Lots of options

335
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
Here added got a lot of

336
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Items already

337
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:25,632
So basically it tooks into while  if you looks out to do if you would also it model and control apart

338
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:34,848
At last part you saw something about the MySQL so you can add a MySQL done to initialize

339
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:38,176
That table on installation

340
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:42,016
And as the usual stuff regarding publishing

341
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,576
And commissions that we all know from

342
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:45,600
Hanni

343
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:47,136
standerd Joomla thing

344
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,696
But that also means that

345
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
At this level you

346
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
The entire workflow in component Builder you can add the same restrictions to

347
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
As we had a for other component so you can have some people in some groups have the right to

348
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Create fields or

349
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,408
Not create Fields create tables

350
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Anything

351
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
But you would want

352
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,600
So here we have

353
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:23,232
The Linked fields the fields that are linked to that table so that's a view of it so

354
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,304
And a overview you can see ok is this sortable

355
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,840
Can I search it

356
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
So you can turn it on and off

357
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,680
Where does it show in a tab

358
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,520
So not everything shows in long how does it

359
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
Order

360
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:42,176
What's with the permissions that's nothing here but links areas

361
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
So there is a whole overview and you can add it each

362
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:52,672
Item from here so you can added the attributes of how you behaves in a list view or in an item View

363
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:57,536
To your hearts desire

364
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,144
He has an opinion that I shouldn't be more than 60 fields in

365
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,704
Admin view yeah

366
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
Not

367
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Unrealistic

368
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:11,616
You can also add conditions

369
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,152
To a field

370
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:16,480
When it's supposed to be shown

371
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,320
On which circumstances so that you can have a

372
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,344
More

373
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
Clean display

374
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
And that's all

375
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,792
Draws back in in one building on the standard Joomla mechanisms

376
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,888
That we have in the XML files to show hide or show on

377
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:39,008
but you can show on

378
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
Something of another field in the XML file

379
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:44,896
So

380
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,968
That in basic covers

381
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:52,320
Of view and the stuff that we have in the

382
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
basic table

383
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
Now obviously you want to

384
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,464
visualize that

385
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
It allows

386
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,192
Dump the thing as a it's called

387
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:12,544
I hope everybody recognize this structure while you have the default

388
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,360
PHP if that's your site view

389
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,920
And then you can split it up in

390
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,992
Separate parts and make it more readable

391
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,552
And those are called the tablets

392
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,416
so you can multiple tablets that you can use in different

393
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Base views

394
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
oh site views

395
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:33,280
To set up your view

396
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,912
And there's an option to

397
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
Add

398
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,984
Layouts

399
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
These are basically the

400
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,384
Joomla layout you set them up through the gooey and then you can reference

401
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,408
them in the 

402
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,688
Usual way

403
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:56,320
The point being that the gooey gives you access to all of these

404
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
Items that typically are

405
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
Normally called

406
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:08,864
Furthermore we are the options to add libraries those are the

407
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,656
Global URL

408
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,752
Stand of support stuff for

409
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:18,080
Bootstrap 4 UI kit

410
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:23,712
a number of libraries what if you have a lot of a framework that you like for JavaScript

411
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:27,040
You can find that for that views for who loads it in

412
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
And it's reference

413
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,624
and you don't need to worry about it

414
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:33,696
It's just an example of how it looks like

415
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,744
where if you got the URL

416
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,512
URL

417
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
The type

418
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:48,032
Yes. If you drags of the libraries is it the always gets latest 

419
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:55,712
No probably not depends on what URL you can provide here so I think in this case is get UI-kit

420
00:25:55,968 --> 00:26:00,320
3.0.0 beta blah blah blah blah for that version

421
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,600
Of

422
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Your created components

423
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:07,488
So once you bring out the new component new version

424
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,512
Your could

425
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:11,328
Check if there's new version UI-Kit

426
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,656
Put it in here and generator

427
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:19,520
your component again. Does it reference or does it really save are just lost.

428
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:24,384
No what's answered here just ends up as a piece of code

429
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
in loading the data but it said we interface to ensure that it gets on all the pages that

430
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,064
is reference

431
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
try to gooey

432
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:39,232
Depending on so this is on cloudflare CDN

433
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:45,632
So it gets it from there so it will just be a reference in the code to load it from there but there's nothing

434
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:49,472
Calling you back to actually set it up locally

435
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
you just change the URL here and then

436
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
Tweak it

437
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,152
Whatever you where you would want to

438
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Now we had a very basic

439
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,528
Table

440
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,088
Field that's one table

441
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,624
But

442
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,648
Yeah that's

443
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,464
At least not our typically my components work

444
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,512
Because we have

445
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:17,888
Want to enroll and relations in decompose on normalizing in your data

446
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,936
So you would want to be able to

447
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:21,472
Combine that

448
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,496
In a view

449
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,312
And that's why the 

450
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
Dynamic get

451
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
Comes in

452
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,992
The dynamic get has two basic tabs. The one that says 

453
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Filter. It says tweak.

454
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:47,328
I hope it's visible and here you can see where it says access level ID in

455
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:50,144
A dot access so that the

456
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,216
so it actually knows about the access level

457
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
Of the user

458
00:27:55,776 --> 00:28:01,152
And since we have a access level in the in that table

459
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,456
Or for that element

460
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
It will ensure that it'll only show

461
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,320
So in the gooey you can

462
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:10,368
Restrict access

463
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
to stuff you can

464
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,024
Have where feel things where you can say Ok I

465
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,328
Only want the published ones

466
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,168
You can

467
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
Sort it

468
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:31,360
you can even set Global thats you can use in your code while Globals is not the best practice but hey

469
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
Here you can do a lot of

470
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Things in

471
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:44,160
Extending your data filtering it you can add this is where you

472
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:46,976
Add search

473
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:48,256
For it by

474
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,864
Here addressing the search

475
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,936
Elements from the post

476
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
And let me make sure that you filter on that so

477
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:00,800
it is very powerful

478
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
This August translated into

479
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,760
Basic database language so typically it's MySQL queries

480
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,160
And all the aspects obviously is

481
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,440
How to

482
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,768
Create relationships because having one table

483
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,608
Probably he refers to other tables

484
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,400
And that's why I this

485
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,192
Is called a joint. I don't think

486
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:31,776
But

487
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:38,176
Now you see your OK series single as B joint a series equal

488
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:42,016
Yeah you find your joining queries between your tables

489
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
So for that view

490
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
You got

491
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
1 combined table

492
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,696
That's also all the information

493
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,232
To be displayed

494
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,536
Which is kind of very 

495
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
Powerful. So indirectly I have joints to the gooey

496
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:05,056
No define dynamically you can add. Can you multiple joints. Yes you can add as many as you want here.

497
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:10,432
So there's no actual limitation

498
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
to it this will just

499
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,528
really translate 1 to 1 in

500
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
MySQL stuff

501
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:23,744
Yes this is a repeatable field you can an add in as many as you want them as complex as you want.

502
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
I can see but you can make any kind of joints.  

503
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:31,936
Yes

504
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,776
Left joint right joint in a joint out the joint

505
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:43,456
So in just that combination we being able to

506
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
Joint tables

507
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,576
Add the filtering

508
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,392
That's an awful lot you can already do

509
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,928
At database level

510
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:59,328
What you can't do a database level you can do at the PHP level where I sort the

511
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,168
Get list items you could do additional stuff there

512
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:05,472
So options are

513
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,008
Forcefully Limitless

514
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,688
Custom code

515
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,968
Not to be

516
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:18,272
confusive be spoke code

517
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:23,904
There is some options to have

518
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:30,560
What is called custom code in the code snippets that you are defining and The Custom code

519
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Could be

520
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
it's basic in the Micros

521
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:37,216
So it's a research and replaced thing you define Snippets

522
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
by

523
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:44,640
Adding this in an axle piece of

524
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,200
Code it will

525
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,040
fetch in that larger piece of code so that you don't need to

526
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,880
Recode your get view ID

527
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:56,160
Every time

528
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:00,768
You can also pass values to that

529
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:04,608
Snippet of code basically it's going down the function

530
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,496
So that's just a centralised your code

531
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
have Functions

532
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
At the gooey level

533
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
Then

534
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,480
Ok this should have been the bespoke code and not the custom code

535
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:21,760
Because that's

536
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
To me that's

537
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
The Unicorn

538
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
thing of this

539
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:30,208
Component builder and this is what got me

540
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:31,744
Interested in it

541
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
There's a lot of options in there

542
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:36,864
but

543
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:41,472
For whatever reason I always end up wanting to change something that can't be changed

544
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
Directly

545
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,520
in the gooey

546
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,336
and That's why I this

547
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:51,456
Computer component builder excels I think

548
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,272
Because it will allow you to

549
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
Add code or change code anywhere

550
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,648
In your compiled component

551
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
The only limitation is that you have to

552
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
Add some

553
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:11,424
Structure on that are commenting on that so that it can be found so that's insert place like this

554
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:15,264
and in with that anything in between there

555
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
Will be inserted

556
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:19,616
The beauty of it if you do that

557
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,920
The

558
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,992
Builder tool will extract these pieces of code

559
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:29,344
And the next time around you build it it will re insert them

560
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,392
So you will

561
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:36,512
Be able to change stuff at any location be it and PHP or HTML

562
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,792
And

563
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,584
Have it be imported

564
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,680
So that would for example mean if you now have a

565
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,240
3.x components

566
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:51,872
Which has a shortened file layout structure etc. etc.

567
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,152
If

568
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
In a few months time

569
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,504
There is a version that can build for

570
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,296
Joomla 4.0

571
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,088
Your changes will be put

572
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,928
In the relevant files in all the locations

573
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:07,744
I won't need worry about it

574
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
It will just build

575
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,400
With your cross and changes that with Joomla 4 

576
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,192
for those

577
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,008
Familiar Joomla 4 has a slightly

578
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,568
Was it works with Joomla 3

579
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,920
The directory structure and file structure

580
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,736
That's not the best practice the best practices

581
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:31,552
Baffles or Shuffle around a little bit

582
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:35,136
Anybody wants to know just ask George

583
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:40,256
He'll be happy to tell you about it

584
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
There is a

585
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:50,752
I've listed the number a number of stuff so you can say insert this or replace a piece of it

586
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,776
existing code

587
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
And

588
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,176
So when it so you see what happens when it gets

589
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Added back in the get again

590
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:04,064
And add some tags so that it can do its homework and actually knows

591
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,880
which piece of soft phrase change that what

592
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,416
Location

593
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:15,584
So this was really what got me enthusiastic about this tool because this is not something

594
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
I've seen

595
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Before

596
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:20,448
And it'll allow for

597
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
Roundtrip development

598
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,032
created it in gooey

599
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:29,664
Modify to your extent in you can already modify lot in the component builder itself

600
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:32,224
If not you can change it anywhere else

601
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,528
And it will be sucked in again

602
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
And then if you want to add a new

603
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,928
Database table in new few extra columns

604
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:48,096
Joomla component builder will take care of that it will create a associated update script for the MySQL databases

605
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,400
It will do everything

606
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,360
Obviously some stuff needs to be compiled

607
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,896
and this is

608
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:04,224
A bit what you can see when it gets compiled

609
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
So

610
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,808
You select your component

611
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:14,208
In this case I've got component builder, sermon distributor, question and answers, demo and demo advanced

612
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,792
select one of them and hit the compile button

613
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:19,328
and that's it

614
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:26,496
Once it's done it make some assumptions assumptions about the time you saved

615
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,712
It's assumptions but yeah so much time you have at least

616
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,808
get the sense that you actually save time because you didn't have to create the

617
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,344
Directory structure

618
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,904
Nothing like that

619
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
Once you compile you can

620
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:50,560
Click on this one to install it immediately or you download it

621
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,608
or you

622
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,656
Reference what ever that code is. 

623
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,616
And if you have it somewhere else Ryan you can use this

624
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,456
URL or path depending on where it is

625
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:16,160
Now you could if you have one development site is easy to run component builder there

626
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:21,024
And because every package can be exported

627
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,840
An imported in an other site

628
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Without problems

629
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:31,776
There is a option to if you have a commercial component to have it encrypted and

630
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
secured by a key

631
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:37,152
So that it only can be installed if you have that key

632
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:44,320
Watching like this in Waterberg

633
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,024
Yeah

634
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,912
Started with some misc stuff you'll find some example for example in there that

635
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:04,544
in the tutorials which I thought really a nice one that adds deals with

636
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:09,152
Drag and drop uploading with all kinds of

637
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:15,808
Filtering on content type security looking if it's PDF

638
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:19,392
Filesize resizing images

639
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:26,048
There's a very complex example there on how to use that with ACL so that only certain group

640
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,840
People can do that

641
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,400
Yes very

642
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
Interested

643
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
Another thing that

644
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:39,616
Probably Rene also would like to see is that there is a sorry

645
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:46,016
I would say I know you but I know most of the people in the room so 

646
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,088
So familiar

647
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,648
Collaborative workflow

648
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:55,744
If you work on so you can work on the

649
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
Sing

650
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,048
Installation

651
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,144
But then you deal with the normal Joomla

652
00:39:02,912 --> 00:39:04,960
Problems of locking up

653
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
your article

654
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,312
And then your article is locked and somebody else cannot work with it

655
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:11,360
What does actually

656
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:14,688
you can't do stuff simultaneously

657
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:18,784
There's actually a workflow setup while you can do

658
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,136
We've multiple developers work on their local insulation

659
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,208
Where the changes get merge

660
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
Using git

661
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,376
So you can have a collaborative workflow

662
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
on that

663
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,728
So the mapped component gets

664
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,544
Versions in your own git stuff

665
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,480
There's also community components that used the same workflow or similar workflow

666
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,784
As a similar way of working we have

667
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,552
The

668
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,136
Upstream repository

669
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:01,280
So you forked that in your local Github you Clone it to your local development and environment

670
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:05,888
You make changes to for simple question and answers component

671
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:08,192
You set up your upstream

672
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
And than you

673
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:13,824
Push it and make a pull request and then

674
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:17,152
Pull request may not be accept it

675
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:23,808
And then you can download the new question and answer component again but that works ok you can also setup locally

676
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
Now for the giveaways

677
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:39,680
So until today are actually until the start of this presentation

678
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:42,240
VDM

679
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:45,312
That's the company for of Llewellyn

680
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:48,896
Sold the mapped component

681
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
Packages

682
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
So

683
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,504
The question-and-answer modules

684
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,552
would cost you 94 dollars

685
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
The Sermon distributor

686
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,392
would cost you 46 dollars

687
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,928
And

688
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,000
The big thing

689
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,560
The component builder so the thing that

690
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:11,424
We are actually talking about which bills itself would such a half

691
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,216
800 dollars

692
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,800
Totalling over a thousand dollars which is a lot of

693
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Money

694
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,968
I have in the last months talking to Llewellyn and he he talking to his team

695
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,808
It was a big change in his attitude and giving back

696
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,112
So anybody that here

697
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:34,464
If you use this link

698
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,888
Take time to take pictures I'll step aside

699
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:50,080
So you can fetch time I meant this presentation this one

700
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,175
Why you can

701
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,735
Hit on me later if you need it

702
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:04,159
All that dates you can get these three packages

703
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:15,167
If you open that page now you will see that you can access these and you

704
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,703
Can get the keys the only thing

705
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:22,079
To be eligible for the keys is that Llewellyn asked you stared share or preferably fork

706
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:23,615
preferably fork

707
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,687
The respective components

708
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,551
If you have a public email address you we should get send the key

709
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,647
Automatically so public email address in get that publicly accessible

710
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
If not

711
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,463
You can claim

712
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,511
Your key on this page

713
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:42,815
So

714
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:44,351
You can get

715
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:49,215
The sermon distributor or the question and answers and the Joomla component builder itself

716
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:52,287
Watch watch fork or stared it

717
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,895
And you got notified if you have a public email address in get

718
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,783
That is very easy in terms of

719
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:06,367
You got to the components you can import the package is here

720
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
So it has an

721
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:10,975
Import JCB packages that you can

722
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,767
They were list

723
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:17,119
No need to search for them you can also see that you can export packages

724
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
And then you got something

725
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:24,287
Like this

726
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
here you add the key that you got distributed

727
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
And this is what shows when you

728
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,671
Progress so I got component build that pay a lot that it's installed

729
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,231
and here it shows the

730
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:49,119
All the extensions I've got a little privilege in getting these

731
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
upfront

732
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,679
So

733
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,031
And so I have keys but don't ask me for keys I will not give them

734
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,591
There's a perfectly simple way to get them

735
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
Just stare fork and share

736
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:02,431
And you got your own key

737
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,223
and with that

738
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,807
I want to say huge thanks and shout out to

739
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,367
Llewellyn van der Merwe

740
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
who is somewhere in

741
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Africa

742
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
And sure to look this back

743
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
Any questions

744
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,119
of this

745
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:29,311
It's a lot to take a knife and try I actually don't know

746
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,103
I know he has employees

747
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,687
But I actually don't know how big his company is the

748
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:41,343
Picture of the office building is huge office building but I don't think he owns it all.

749
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:48,255
This is a huge thing I guess you didn't click this together in one afternoon at least he didn't no absolute not he work very hard the last days.  It isa real good package. why didn't we heard of it before 

750
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
I don't know

751
00:44:56,703 --> 00:45:02,847
I have you have heard or came across it before and that's actually how

752
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:05,151
I urged it my son to use it

753
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:12,319
I actually heard of it years back but to me it's a bit like Joomla itself

754
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:18,719
I heard about it but only when I saw that it started to be multilingual and that access control

755
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:20,511
in the core I got interested

756
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
And the thing that got me interested in here is the fact that I can do modification in any location of my

757
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,775
Component I have no limitations on that and I can still do aroundtrip development

758
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,407
By giving back obviously Llewellyn hope someone's

759
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:40,223
Everybody to contribute as so that we

760
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,295
He can extend this even further

761
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:49,183
And I've already started to talk with my friend from the JoomDD

762
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:55,583
To see if there's maybe that's Common Ground because I also very much like their idea about having model driven

763
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,607
Development

764
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:01,983
Don't know how to reach it yet but since it's now going to be open source two ways

765
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
the option exist

766
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
And that's really exciting to me.

767
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:17,087
Yeah you could use it but you couldn't change it and

768
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,743
It was totally free

769
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:30,143
And you could use it for free but you could you couldn't have the mapped component and so the one that builds itself and change that

770
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,959
And you wouldn't have the

771
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:39,359
Example components example components so that you could look how does he do this how does he

772
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,687
Filter how does he do this

773
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:45,503
And starting

774
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:51,903
Yeah but starting today you have two example components that

775
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:58,303
Will really help you on the libs that I struggled in finding things out

776
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
And you have a Joomla component builder where I hope that the community will take it up and

777
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Ok

778
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:17,503
So i've been 

779
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:22,367

780
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,183
