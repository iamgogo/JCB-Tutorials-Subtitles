00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:04,608
Ok well recently I was asked whether

2
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:07,680
I'm seriously saying that Hella World

3
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:13,312
Tutorial should be an hour long and I had to laugh because of course

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:19,712
That tutorial is doing way more than what a Hello World tutorial should do right so

5
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:25,856
Here it goes we gonna do the real quick Hello World tutorial we go to extensions

6
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:27,392
Install

7
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,464
We searched for JCB

8
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:34,816
We open it

9
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:37,632
And we click install

10
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:39,680
And again install

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,032
On success we go to component Builder

12
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
And we click on

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,920
Import JCB packages

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,248
We go to VDM packages we select

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,528
The

16
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
Hello World

17
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:59,904
Component for free with click get package

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:04,768
We'd see that it has a checksum validation 413

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
4

20
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,352
We click this a link here

21
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:13,216
To check and make sure that it is the same key as on GitHub

22
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
So we can check that that key

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
Matches this one

24
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
And it does

25
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,896
So we know it's a package

26
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
Still

27
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,456
Authentic and

28
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,064
Then we we can say yes Force update and click continue

29
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:35,488
Great import was successful and we go back to Joomla components we see that our Hello World component has

30
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,768
Been installed

31
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,072
We go to compiler

32
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
And we click Hello World

33
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,680
And compile

34
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,776
It successfully compiled so we click install

35
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
And

36
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,384
We look at the back end

37
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,200
We create a greeting

38
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:58,272
Say

39
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,600
Hi James

40
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:05,440
Save and close

41
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,000
And so our first greeting is set

42
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
We go to menu

43
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:17,728
Main menu we change the main menu to be a selection

44
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
type

45
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,032
Hello World

46
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,312
Greetings

47
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
And

48
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760
That should be it we save and close

49
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:37,184
And we click on Joomla Mount we see there is a page 

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
Is not directing properly

51
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,608
So that might be a problem in the component we go back to hello world

52
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
And we click on the global options

53
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,448
And permissions

54
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,008
And we search for site

55
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,616
Because there are some site views that we need to allow

56
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
it to show

57
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
Public

58
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
That one and

59
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
That one

60
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,600
so those two will show and

61
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,928
yeah we save out of here we refresh to front

62
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:10,208
And there we have it

63
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,744
There is a greeting

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,512
Hi

65
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:16,608
James we can click on it

66
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:20,448
And it says hi James we can go back one

67
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
And then click on edit

68
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,080
It says I'm not allowed to edit I'm not in the edit group

69
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,408
We can go back to the backend click on options

70
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:35,808
And we could actually give me edit permissions as public but I think you get the point

71
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:40,160
Hello world in place functional and

72
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:43,232
It was really very quickly to do

73
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:49,632
And that is the quick or the real hello world how to set up a Hello world component in

74
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:50,912
Joomla

75
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:54,496
Component builder without

76
00:03:55,008 --> 00:03:58,336
Waiting a whole hour thanks for watching
