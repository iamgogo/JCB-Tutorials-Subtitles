00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Hi

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:04,096
We are looking at admin views

3
00:00:04,864 --> 00:00:05,632
Which is

4
00:00:05,888 --> 00:00:08,192
The next thing to be setting up

5
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:08,960
In

6
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:09,984
Developing your component

7
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,544
So first we started with

8
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:14,080
Field types

9
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
Looking at

10
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,944
How to setup field types or improve on them

11
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
Then

12
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,296
We looked at how to use those field types to build

13
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:24,064
Basic

14
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,368
Common fields

15
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,976
Now we gonna look at how to take those fields

16
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,256
And add them

17
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:33,280
To admin views

18
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,328
Admin views

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,888
Like I explained in our initial

20
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
General planning

21
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,704
Video

22
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:44,544
It is basically from the BedRock

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,336
The basis of your

24
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,128
Components database structure

25
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,712
so your admin views is where your Database

26
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:53,248
Structure is being

27
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,040
Developed

28
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,880
All your admin views which have their own table

29
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,232
Now as we explained admin views have a single

30
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,328
Name and and has a list record

31
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
or a plural name

32
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,656
And then there is a system name

33
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:13,216
And the reason why there they actually have 3

34
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:15,776
Is that let's say you have

35
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
Wanna reuse this

36
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,128
Specific admin View

37
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,664
In another component

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:27,296
With the same name but obviously adapting it to that component

39
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,112
The idea would be that you would then have two preachers

40
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,184
Showing up in your selection list

41
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
When you added to the component

42
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
And so that might be difficult to discern

43
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,584
Which is which

44
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
And so

45
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,680
You can add the name of that specific component

46
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,704
As part of

47
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,008
Just differentiating between

48
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,288
The same

49
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,056
Names

50
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,336
That means you can have

51
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,128
Admin views with the same name

52
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,944
But with different implementation

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Fact that is how

54
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,784
You can do different version control

55
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
Concepts on

56
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,088
Components

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
Using the same admin do

58
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Just inside of it

59
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,976
Making a few changes and in Saving it

60
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:10,304
So you could do that

61
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
Open preacher for example

62
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,888
And in here

63
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:15,936
You could say free version

64
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,496
This is the free version and then save as copy

65
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
And then you can

66
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,336
Change the field that is linked

67
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:25,152
You can change some of the linked views

68
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:28,224
You can change some of your CSS will whatever

69
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,760
Other things you have done

70
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,576
Regarding this admin view

71
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
And then go to the free version of that component

72
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,696
And Link the

73
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
That specific one

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,328
That specific view instead of the other

75
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
Away maybe I'm getting ahead of myself I usually do

76
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
So let's focus on admin views now

77
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,824
to create a admin view you obviously just click new

78
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
I'm gonna

79
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
Open preacher again because this is the one we are using

80
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
As our illustration

81
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,504
And

82
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,272
You would

83
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,832
See that there should be a name for a single record

84
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,392
Again that is where you would edit

85
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
This records so that is

86
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
In this case I said preacher

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,048
And then there is a list of Records

88
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,584
And that's preachers

89
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
Then a short description

90
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,680
And a normal description

91
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:20,960
Depending on

92
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
What you would like to say

93
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:26,848
Then there is a type now the read write and the read only

94
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,920
Changes the components editing

95
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
view

96
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
If you say read only

97
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,552
Then it will basically limit

98
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:40,160
The fields to being not you will not be able to edit them

99
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,976
If you remember in the

100
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
In this area

101
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
Here

102
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,888
The modified "By field" cannot be edited

103
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
Because it's done automatically and when it was modified is

104
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Is also updated us every time you

105
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,544
You click save

106
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:00,640
So this area can not be edited and that's how all

107
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,688
The fields are gonna look

108
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
If you select

109
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,480
Read only

110
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:08,576
If you if you leave it on read write it will look like this

111
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,368
and you will be able to edit it

112
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
Ok so that is

113
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,440
Looking at these

114
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:16,000
Fields now there is a place for an icon

115
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:19,839
if you hover over the icon It gives you the dimensions that is needed

116
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,655
This basically is the icon

117
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,935
Then when you look

118
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
At

119
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,007
The dashboard

120
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
These icons

121
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,103
Are the one selected there

122
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,895
Ok so

123
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,175
You can see that

124
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,015
The icon has two of them one is the add icon

125
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:41,599
And one is there just a normal icon so if you hover here

126
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:44,927
You should see the image if it is

127
00:04:45,183 --> 00:04:45,951
Set in

128
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:46,719
In your

129
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
In yours

130
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,863
Images folder sorry

131
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
So if you open the this

132
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,727
It goes to your image folder you select the icon

133
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
When you hover here obviously those images

134
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,311
are not in this image folder so it does not show up

135
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:08,479
And then if you gonna add preachers are you if you gonna add a field

136
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
Just a field

137
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:13,599
called category that is of the category type

138
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
Then you should add a category icon

139
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
Since then

140
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:23,071
The system will automatically know ok there need to be a category setup

141
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
And it will look for this icon to use

142
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:26,911
For that category

143
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
And

144
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,215
If you select a

145
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,335
Category field that is a general category for the whole component

146
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:36,127
Which isn't directly linked

147
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,151
To this

148
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,687
View

149
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
Then it will take the first view

150
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:44,831
The system will look at which view when it processes it

151
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:47,135
Which view is the first one

152
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,951
And usually that would be the first one you've

153
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,719
Created

154
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
And it will use the icon in that

155
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,375
But to be on the safe side if you using 1 category for them all

156
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Just set the same icon on them all

157
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,495
But if you are gonna use a category

158
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:05,311
Which is primarily focused on the preachers

159
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,895
And you just gonna put preachers and a category

160
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,455
Then you need to add a category

161
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
Icon here

162
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:13,247
Four categories

163
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,807
now permissional switch

164
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:19,135
It's got to do with your accessing and

165
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,671
Updating of data

166
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
So like you can see here

167
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
We have

168
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,047
View edit

169
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
View edit State

170
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
View edit own

171
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,935
Views create

172
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,239
Admin views delete

173
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,567
admin view access admin view edit version

174
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:39,615
Now this edit

175
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:45,247
If it's set if your own this managing group and it set to a aloud then you can edit it

176
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,807
If you are a guest and it said to

177
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,575
Deny

178
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
I no Matter Where You are in

179
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,903
The front or the back of the site

180
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
You won't be able to edit

181
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,279
this information even if you have a Direct Link

182
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,327
It won't allow you to edit it

183
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,887
Now it also has view access

184
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,703
So somebody who might be not allowed to

185
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Edit it

186
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
May be allowed to

187
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
View

188
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
This

189
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,591
this content

190
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
in the back end in the list view

191
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,247
Then it will show in the list view and they can see that it is there

192
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,271
Now you might

193
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,831
Think yourself why would I ever wanna do that

194
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,647
And you see because of your custom admin

195
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,487
Views and the way that you can connect them to your admin views

196
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
Which will look at later

197
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,095
You might want to display the record and

198
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:34,399
Just leave an custom admin link

199
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,423
to

200
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
the data

201
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
Let me give show an example of a

202
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:41,311
Component that does that

203
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
You see here

204
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,943
There is a button underneath

205
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:48,735
The company name

206
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
So it displays the record

207
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
But

208
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,855
If I was

209
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:56,159
Like this one whose profile is set to

210
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:56,927
To being locked

211
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
If I was to click on this

212
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,255
You tell me

213
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:02,559
That I do not have the permission to edit it

214
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,887
But if I was to click on this icon

215
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:09,471
It actually loads the information that I

216
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,239
Looking for

217
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
And

218
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,055
That is the difference

219
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,895
The differences sometimes you wanna use a custom see this is a custom

220
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
Admin View

221
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
And you might want to

222
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Do something

223
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
That is not a

224
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
Editing view but a custom View

225
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:30,207
And then you would like to

226
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,511
see the record but not edited

227
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,559
So that's really what

228
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,631
What that is all about

229
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Ok so

230
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,007
We are back here

231
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:46,335
And we are looking at the missions

232
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:47,615
So

233
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Opening this permission tab

234
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
You'd see that there is edit a view edit

235
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
View edit own

236
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
View edit state and

237
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:00,159
All these have been created usually when you open this it might look like

238
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,183
That

239
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,679
Look like that

240
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,751
So you would set the first one and that you would see there are

241
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,591
Two options one is core edit and one is view edit

242
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
The core edit

243
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,407
Means

244
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,431
That

245
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:25,247
You want to do a global

246
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Switch

247
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:26,783
Now

248
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
Let me try and explain that by opening

249
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,975
Component Builders options

250
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
We haven't actually looked at this yet but it is quite important

251
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,703
You see that it all components in Joomla you have what is called the create edit

252
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Delete

253
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Edit State edit own

254
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
it is this list

255
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
Of options

256
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,199
Which means that if you select

257
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
This

258
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
You know that they can't create something

259
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,063
Then

260
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,135
It is applicable to

261
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,183
Everything in this component

262
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,487
Because it's a global setting so

263
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,559
Everything that doesn't have a view name behind it

264
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,839
Like this is a view name

265
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:15,167
And it says access

266
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
This is a view name

267
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,983
and it says batch use

268
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,031
But this is only batch use

269
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:25,407
So that's the global for batch use and this is only related to this view

270
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
So you can say I am allowing them to

271
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Do a batch function

272
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,087
But in this admin view I don't

273
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Want to allow

274
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Sorry

275
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,415
Don't wanna allow them

276
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
To do a batch function

277
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
Or you could say

278
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:43,071
You know what I wanna use inheritance

279
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
So that means I'm gonna do that

280
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
I want them to be able to do batch functions here

281
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,031
And in this view

282
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,359
Now the reason why you can do it in two places then

283
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,199
Is that you have a global switch to stop them from doing it

284
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,271
But you can also locally to the view

285
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,575
Tweak whether they are able to

286
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,343
To edit

287
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,903
Do some of these features

288
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,719
So coming back to the

289
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Way that you would set that up

290
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,583
If you don't want to have a separate

291
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,119
Control

292
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:17,887
For this

293
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
View

294
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,007
In relation to whether it can edit it or

295
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,543
Or whether you could

296
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,407
Change it all view it all these

297
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,687
Possibilities

298
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:32,479
Then you would use core

299
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:36,831
And core would mean that you would have only this one switch

300
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,951
And if you say deny it will it automatically deny it for that View

301
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
And any other view that is using

302
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:45,023
core

303
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,815
or core can be seen as Global

304
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
When when you are setting it as

305
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
View

306
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,215
edit view

307
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
It means that the system will generate

308
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
A specific list of items

309
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
Specially just for that View

310
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
So if you look

311
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
From there to there

312
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,735
That's for your admin View

313
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
from there to there is for your custom

314
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Admin View

315
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,879
Now that means

316
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,903
What I set up

317
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:13,951
This in a component Builder

318
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,743
I selected view edit

319
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:20,863
And then I said in relation to each record in relation to the whole View

320
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
And I selected

321
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Both

322
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
So

323
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:25,727
Then it will implement it for the

324
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
For both

325
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,823
And single record and it will implemented

326
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:31,359
For your Global settings

327
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,175
Now again it might feel

328
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,015
I won't blame you if what I have just tried

329
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
Explaining

330
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Makes you feel

331
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:40,831
confused

332
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
But

333
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Really

334
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:48,511
The only way for you to make sense of this is if you know how Joomla provisional structure works

335
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,351
So if you are using a Joomla website

336
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
And you have actually ever

337
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:56,959
Gone to articles

338
00:12:58,495 --> 00:12:59,775
And opened options

339
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
and then look at their permissions

340
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
Then you'd see that they only have create edit

341
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,431
Delete

342
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,967
Edit State edit own

343
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,271
And then these accessing of the control

344
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,295
And this batchally

345
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,319
This big

346
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
Global settings

347
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:17,439
Now what we are doing as we simply adding

348
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
More control

349
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,559
Then only these default because the way this works

350
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
In article manager you basically have

351
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
1 view

352
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,959
That view is articles

353
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,263
These are the views

354
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,103
Own's as categories is another view but it really has another component

355
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,127
It's not really

356
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Content

357
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,175
The content component

358
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:39,967
An admin features

359
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,015
Is just another implementation

360
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,807
It's not really a whole new Database

361
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,879
It's ok so the point is

362
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:50,463
You only really have two well the most two views here

363
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,535
And so when they look at options

364
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,167
They know that if they tweak this permission they want it to be implemented

365
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,471
For all the views related to articles

366
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Right

367
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
Well with component Builder you are able to build components

368
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,359
That are far bigger

369
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,407
Then the content managing

370
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:10,687
Article manager

371
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,991
Ok I'm because of that

372
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,551
We felt that your permissions must extend

373
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:20,671
That you can target a specific view and not just all of them at once

374
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:24,255
So if you want to Target a specific View

375
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,535
You will select

376
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:26,559
The

377
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
View edit

378
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
Actually this view

379
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,911
Prefix

380
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
Must be in your selection

381
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
If you select

382
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Core

383
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
That means you are saying

384
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,359
I don't want to specifically target this view

385
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:42,431
If I change it in the global settings which would be

386
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,479
The ones without a view name in

387
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Front

388
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
Everything

389
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
From

390
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,063
Here

391
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
to There

392
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,135
those are the global settings

393
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Global export Global batch

394
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:54,975
global version

395
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
Edit version

396
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,047
Global create

397
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Delete

398
00:14:59,071 --> 00:15:03,423
Edit edit State now edit state is changing it from publish to unpublish those things

399
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:08,543
Edit own means you might not have edit rights but he has edit own rights

400
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:11,359
So that means whatever you create c can edit again

401
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,687
In and created by is a field

402
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:17,503
so can he edit created by field

403
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:21,599
Or Can he edit create date field

404
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
Now

405
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
You'd see that

406
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,463
This basically targets

407
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,607
Fields that are sort of the default fields

408
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,423
There is a way to Target

409
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:38,239
Custom Fields Fields that were developed

410
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,311
Outside of the default fields

411
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:43,103
But that is not done in

412
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Here

413
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:49,759
I'll Show you where that is done this is just controlling your default Fields and your default

414
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Features with regards to

415
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Permissions

416
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
And

417
00:15:54,623 --> 00:16:00,255
So you would first set up these permissions make sure that you set up all of those that you want to implement

418
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,607
There is a list here of those I think is most general

419
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:06,655
This list might

420
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:07,935
Grow with time

421
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
But because we've moved

422
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
The control of a single field

423
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,335
Out of this

424
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:15,871
Structure

425
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
It actually means that we've made it scalable

426
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
So this

427
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:22,015
Permissional implementation here

428
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
Is really only Targeting your

429
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
or default fields

430
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
or the fields that

431
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:28,671
Already the system put in for you

432
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
And the default

433
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,511
Concepts like accessing

434
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,559
This specific View

435
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:38,143
Or deleting an item in the view or creating an item

436
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
Or editing the created

437
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,263
Field or editing the created by field

438
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,055
Changing the state

439
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,871
Edit own So those are the custom

440
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,407
Default features

441
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:55,039
If you wanna do a control on a specific field I'll show you that in a moment

442
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
But

443
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,367
That is the implementation

444
00:16:58,623 --> 00:16:59,391
Of permissions

445
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,951
If you do not really

446
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,487
Understand this

447
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
I would suggest you make

448
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
Effort

449
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,887
To study up on Joomla's own implementation

450
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:10,655
Sorry

451
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,935
Off

452
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:13,727
The promotional structure

453
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:18,335
Then once you've really understood the way Joomla

454
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,383
Handles this permissional structure

455
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,687
Then you would have better grips on

456
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:23,711
Setting up these

457
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
permissions

458
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,503
Per view

459
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
What is done in the code if you would like to see that

460
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,647
It's basically in the code

461
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
If your ready have developed a

462
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Component

463
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,279
You see that it sets up

464
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
Your Globals

465
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
This is the global now when I say Global

466
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
I mean

467
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,007
If you click on options

468
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,287
let me just close this

469
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,199
If you click on this button here options in any of the components

470
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
You're going to the global settings

471
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Ok

472
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
And

473
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,367
These permissions here

474
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:03,903
are

475
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:05,695
Those first that I've highlighted

476
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,487
So it all those

477
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,535
And they have

478
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Links

479
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
To the specific

480
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,911
Views so there is the field View

481
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,703
There is the

482
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,799
Dynamic get view there is the custom admin View

483
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
And you can see that they have there

484
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,639
Related switches

485
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,943
Ok but then there's also

486
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:29,503
For each view their own Section

487
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,319
And that causes Joomla

488
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,647
to add in an item a permissional tab

489
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,487
With switching to control the permission for this one

490
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,023
Individual item

491
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
And

492
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
We have tried our very best

493
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,935
To implement these permissions actually

494
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
The way that you want might expect

495
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,615
I can in later videos going to the code and show you exactly how

496
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:58,687
This permission structure is being implemented

497
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:02,015
and I think it's one of the features that makes component Builder

498
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,295
Far more advanced

499
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,599
Then other component Builders out there

500
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:12,255
Is the ability to add permissional structures to your component right inside of component Builder

501
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,023
Through

502
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:13,791
This

503
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,071
Permissional switch

504
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
Ok

505
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:21,471
And so we will will definitely be speaking about this permissional structure

506
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,751
As we go along

507
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,847
The tab structure if you look at these we call them tabs

508
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:30,431
Settings Fields CSS JavaScript PHP my SQL

509
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,455
Published

510
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,735
And permissions

511
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
The Publishing permissions

512
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
are

513
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
tabs that are built

514
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Automatically

515
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
For all

516
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:40,671
Backend

517
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Admin views

518
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
Old admin views

519
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,631
Have this permission and well the permission only if if set

520
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
And

521
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Published

522
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,471
Will always be there

523
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
In published we basically bundle your

524
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,847
Your the fields that are built

525
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
Dynamically

526
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Without you having to set them I think

527
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,063
that is what you could say

528
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:12,927
With publishing all those Fields that you do not need to set

529
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Are always placed in

530
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,231
Publishing

531
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,375
And so everything else this MySQL tab here the PHP JavaScript CSS

532
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
Fields and settings

533
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,007
Are actually an example of what tabs can be

534
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,543
Now in preacher

535
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,847
I actually setup

536
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:31,871
Two tabs

537
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
1 called

538
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Details

539
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,199
And one called sermons

540
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
Ok so there are two tabs in preachers

541
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
So that means if you were to open the preacher

542
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
Backend View

543
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,415
First one would be called settings

544
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
The second one will be called

545
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:49,023
Sermons and then you'd see publishing and permission

546
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,815
So that's how I would look

547
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,119
Now when you create fields

548
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:56,447
You see that there is a column here called tab

549
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,799
And you then will select the number now the tags

550
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
Are number from one to

551
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,359
Whatever

552
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:07,711
We don't start at zero or though that might have made more sense for programmers

553
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
We started with

554
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
One

555
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,807
So first tab second tab

556
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
And

557
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
Because we are using

558
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,928
A place different

559
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
From the tabs we don't use the names

560
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,328
So you need to remember that this is tab one this is tab two

561
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,120
So when you set up a field

562
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,424
You need to tell us in which tab

563
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
Do you want a place that feel

564
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,496
Ok

565
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
So

566
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
That is what this tab

567
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
Number here is all about

568
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:40,736
Now you might say but where is tab two's information because their sermons right

569
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
Well

570
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
Because of the fact that sermons

571
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:46,624
Is an actually

572
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
A table on its own

573
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,976
If we go out here

574
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
We will see that there is a

575
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,888
Admin view called sermon

576
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
And it is his own

577
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
backend View

578
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,776
And it has its own structure

579
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,056
So

580
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
How can I

581
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
Get

582
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
The sermons

583
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
That is only related to this

584
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Preacher

585
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:17,600
To be showing in the second tab called sermons

586
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,416
What we created the thing called linked views

587
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:24,256
now linked views is the place where this is done

588
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,560
So basically

589
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:28,608
I selected sermon as the view

590
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:30,400
I said it should

591
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,192
Be placed in the second tab

592
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,752
And in child key

593
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,568
Is preacher so if I think about sermons

594
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,592
Which is the child

595
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,384
Sermon is the child

596
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,432
Preacher is the parent

597
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:49,088
So you would always think of the parent as this the view in which you are the moment you are setting up the linked

598
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:49,856
View

599
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:50,880
So that

600
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:52,416
If you are in preacher

601
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
The parent is preacher

602
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:57,024
If you are in sermons

603
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,816
The parent is sermon

604
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
So depends on in which view your busy editing

605
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,448
And so here

606
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,008
When we talk about the child key

607
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,824
This would be the database field name

608
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,152
That that is to be looked at

609
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,688
And the parent

610
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:18,272
Field name that should be found inside of this

611
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
So when we look at preachers

612
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
You would let's go back to

613
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
Sermon

614
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
let me quickly close this

615
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,376
Ok we got sermon open here and if I open there this fields

616
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,168
Well I don't need to open it

617
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
here in fact let me us another place

618
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
It is Easier to see

619
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:41,056
Let's go to fields

620
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
You'll see that there is a field called name

621
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,736
Ok wait there's a field called

622
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Preacher where is it? preacher preacher

623
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
next page possibly no why am I not seeing it

624
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
custom there it is

625
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Sorry

626
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
Ok so this is the field

627
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
That we want

628
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,520
Connected to

629
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
With each other right

630
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,080
So do to get

631
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:17,152
The sermons that belongs to that preacher

632
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:20,992
We need to get the ID of this field now that's a custom field

633
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:24,064
And we said that we are gonna look at custom fields

634
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
Only after explaining the admin

635
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,672
views so I'm gonna go into detail now

636
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,976
But I'm gonna open that field None the less

637
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,048
And I'm gonna show you that it's name is preacher

638
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,864
And because that field

639
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
Will be connected

640
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:41,472
to sermon it means that in the database

641
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
the ID

642
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Which is the key field

643
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,616
Is gonna be saved in preacher

644
00:24:48,128 --> 00:24:50,432
So that means the ID of the preacher

645
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,992
Is saved inside of the preacher

646
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Column

647
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,296
In the database

648
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,856
now let me show you that in the database itself

649
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,440
Ok so here I am in the database

650
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,232
With Sermon distributor

651
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,536
And I'm opening sermons

652
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,352
And you'd see that we would scroll

653
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,400
Until we see preacher

654
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
And it has ID's in it

655
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,568
And those are the ID of the Preacher's themselves

656
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
So if I was to go to preacher

657
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,968
it basically means that we are linking

658
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
To this ID here

659
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
Ok

660
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:28,832
So

661
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
Going back to our

662
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Linked view concept

663
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
That means the child

664
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Database table

665
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,608
In which the ID of this preacher must be

666
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,376
Found

667
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,912
Is in preacher

668
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
the parent

669
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:44,960
Key

670
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,264
Would be this preachers ID

671
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:50,080
And so by doing that

672
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:53,408
The linked view will only show the sermons

673
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,688
That are related

674
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,968
to this

675
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Specific preacher

676
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,320
And that is how the linked views can be linked

677
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:04,928
If you didn't select these correctly it won't load all of them

678
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:05,952
Ok

679
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,000
well it won't work well

680
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
So there needs to be that tight relationship

681
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
Between the parent and the child

682
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,656
View

683
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:15,936
So

684
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,496
there's also a way

685
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
To actually link

686
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,824
An array from an array

687
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,848
So let's say

688
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
The person is able to select more than one preacher

689
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
There is a way for you to also

690
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,576
Type that but that would all be dealt with in advanced

691
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
concepts

692
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
Since that is

693
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Well I could

694
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:38,208
Explain some of it here

695
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:40,768
but best

696
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,536
be let me show you

697
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:47,936
That would be one of the syntax to use

698
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
But like I said

699
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,544
Think I possibly need to deal with this in advanced concepts

700
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:56,384
Because who will know to look for the answer in this video or tutorial

701
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,224
So we'll stay with the basics here

702
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:01,760
So the basic

703
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:03,552
Way of linking a

704
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,112
Another view would be to select that View

705
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
From this dropdown

706
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
Then say in which tab it should display

707
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,000
Then

708
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
What is the child's

709
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,096
Database table in which to look

710
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:19,680
What is the parents value to use

711
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:20,960
to

712
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,496
Build a relationship

713
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:25,568
And then this add new button or no

714
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,384
Is basically  when you look at a

715
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:30,944
let me Close this

716
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
When you look at Fields here

717
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
You see it has a new button

718
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,952
So you can in that switch there decide whether it should

719
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,976
Show it would not

720
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,792
I should tell you that if you say yes

721
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,584
And you have

722
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:51,680
In that view created the correct permissional of structure

723
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
for

724
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,008
Whether somebody can create

725
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,312
An item

726
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,128
You can control the display of that

727
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
New button

728
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:05,504
With just setting the permission of that users specific group

729
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,856
So if that user is in a group that doesn't have permissions to

730
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,904
Create new items for

731
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
In this example

732
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:13,696
for

733
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,488
Preachers or for sermons

734
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,304
Then that new button will also not show up

735
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:20,352
So we have that permissional wrapped

736
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
Round that button's display methods

737
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,704
Ok

738
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
That is

739
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,032
The tabs

740
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
Just looking at the tabs

741
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
That's really what we were looking at

742
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,688
And then explaining to you

743
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,968
The how to link

744
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
other views

745
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,552
To it

746
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
To other views

747
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:43,392
So that you can have the data displayed inside of each other

748
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,696
Basically this feature we have here

749
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,816
So the fact that we are busy in preachers and we are able to display the fields

750
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:52,352
That are being used

751
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,376
Well

752
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,912
As you can imagine

753
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
These fields

754
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
Are linked to preachers

755
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,288
From this column here

756
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,104
So we are using a

757
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,152
Repeatable field structure

758
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
And we are able to

759
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:07,968
Link

760
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:08,736
Connect

761
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
The field names

762
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
To this

763
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
View

764
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:16,160
Now let me show you how I did that so I'm

765
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:18,720
Looks like I'm gonna show you anyway

766
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
Ok I'm opening the admin The View

767
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,288
Which is the one we looking at

768
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
I'm going to link two views

769
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,200
And you see that I have there and are in the pointer

770
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,760
And the world field

771
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
So if you are

772
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,320
Trying to connect

773
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
A View to a

774
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
To the

775
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,160
From the parent

776
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:52,000
An independent it is stored in at fields

777
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,048
That's the database

778
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,864
column Name so if we go to the database

779
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
Go to

780
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Component Builder

781
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,080
Admin views

782
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
And we

783
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
scroll

784
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,528
You see there's add fields

785
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,320
And if I open that

786
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
You see that the way it stores it

787
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:21,696
Is it stores the ID is then it stores the list

788
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:24,000
So there's a way in which your

789
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,304
Repeatable fields are stored by Joomla

790
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,144
And the value that I need to look up is in field

791
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:32,704
So in the repeatable field called

792
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,472
Addfields

793
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,288
There is a field called field

794
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,872
And it should look for the ID of the

795
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:43,456
Sorry of the

796
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:47,552
Fields

797
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,368
So it need to look in Addfields

798
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
In the field

799
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:53,952
Array

800
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,488
For the IDs

801
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
That it needs to fetch

802
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:00,096
And the way you would map that in the

803
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
Connect a

804
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,680
A linked view

805
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
is you would say that this is a capital R

806
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,592
For repeatable Fields basically that is the convention to

807
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,664
To tell the system it's a repeatable field we looking in

808
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
And inside of the repeatable field

809
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,760
We must look in the

810
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Field array

811
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
For those ID's and they should map to the child's

812
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
ID

813
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
So does that make sense

814
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
I hope so

815
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,024
Because that's the way it's done

816
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,608
And if that wasn't a repeatable field but an array

817
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:34,400
You would simply say array

818
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
And

819
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
If if the array is just the values themselves you would drop off any pointer to

820
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,360
Specific value

821
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
But if it's an array with

822
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:48,224
And it's actually a

823
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,320
So if it's an associative array

824
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:54,112
You would just add the name

825
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Of the

826
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
associative key

827
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,000
That it needs to look

828
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:03,072
If it's just a normal array without Association

829
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Leave it like that

830
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:08,192
So this would just tell the system it is a array

831
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,728
And it needs to look

832
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,544
Inside of those values for these IDs

833
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:17,408
Ok so that's sort of explains the linking of an admin View

834
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,712
To another admin View

835
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
Now getting on with

836
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:25,856
The

837
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
Setting up of fields

838
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,720
Now since we've already created the fields

839
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Beforehand

840
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
You will

841
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
Usually start out this way

842
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,192
It will looks like that

843
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,544
And the fields that you have created you would scroll down

844
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,592
if it is a long list

845
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,920
You just start with typing that Fields name

846
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:52,992
and it will sort of bringing it up to you

847
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,064
Then it ask you whether you

848
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:58,368
Would like to show this field in the admin View

849
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
The admin list for you

850
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,464
And that means

851
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
If you've closed

852
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,280
Your

853
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,072
Editing area

854
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:11,424
There is a list of names here

855
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
And if you want

856
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:15,776
That specific field to show up in this list

857
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
Then you would select

858
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Show

859
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:24,480
If you have selected show you could tell us in which order you want this

860
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
Must be the first one second one

861
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,624
And we thought while you shouldn't do more than 100, it will look

862
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,392
Ridiculous

863
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,952
So you can say I want this one to

864
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
show up first

865
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,256
Now

866
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,072
The title  Alias concept in Joomla

867
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,864
Is is quite interesting

868
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
An obviously

869
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
It's actually needed

870
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:45,984
Especially if you want to do

871
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
History control

872
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Or

873
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:52,128
Integration with Joomla's infrastructure when it comes to

874
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,432
their history and tagging systems

875
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,480
You need to add

876
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,504
A title and a

877
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,040
Alias to all your items

878
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,344
Sorry to all your views

879
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,440
Especially if it is a view that is gonna be used in the front

880
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,816
So in this case since we are gonna use preachers in the front to display list of preachers

881
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:15,168
We most certainly gonna add a title and we gonna use the name as the title

882
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,472
Then again back to the backend

883
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:22,336
Do we want to have this sortable so

884
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:25,152
Do we want this thing to be clickable there

885
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
So you can click on it

886
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,224
And it sorts the table

887
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,760
Alphabetically

888
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,064
On the basis of this table

889
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Sorry column

890
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,648
So if you wanna have it sortable

891
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:36,928
then do you want

892
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
to have this

893
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,488
Field be searchable

894
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:43,072
Do you want someone to type into this box

895
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
We take warehouse for example

896
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:48,960
Type it in their search

897
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,520
Do you want it to

898
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:52,288
Show

899
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
Only that

900
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Specific field

901
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,224
So if you want them to be able to search for it

902
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
You say yes

903
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,832
Then the filter option is a tricky one

904
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:12,000
You don't wanna set name to filtering because then it will show a list of all the names that already is being

905
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,280
shown in the table

906
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:18,144
you only want to use filter on things that are like a radio box

907
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
or a

908
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Other

909
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,216
View or

910
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:27,616
You know Fields that actually are not all being displayed one after the other

911
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
In the table so for our example I added let's go

912
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
Go to sermon distributor and preacher I added

913
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:46,816
No extra Fields there but at sermons I added preacher

914
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:53,216
So there's a list of all the preachers here so I could sift and say ok I don't want to see this pictures

915
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:59,616
Sermons and then it shows up only those so that is the filters and the way that you set up

916
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:06,016
The filter is simply by clicking yes or no here and it will set up that that filter for you

917
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:12,416
Then this link if you are setting up it custom field and you want to be able to

918
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,816
In the display of the list have it clickable so I can click here and actually go

919
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
to that preacher you see and then click close and then I'm back in the

920
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:31,616
Sermons list view I could also click on series and all take me to the series and I can edit the

921
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:38,016
Series immediately click close and take me back to the list view so if you want that

922
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:44,416
Feature for the specific item then you need to tick yes here now usually we used

923
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:50,816
the name as you see here to be the clickable field the title sorry

924
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:57,216
If you select your title here and you click link then your

925
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
Actually Telling us that this item this field item here is actually what we should use

926
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:10,016
Use as the clickable option to open that actual sermon

927
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:16,416
So here we'll have that actual sermon opening up and all it's related fields

928
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:22,816
So that is the way for us to know which field should be used as the clickable field

929
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:29,216
If you have a title now

930
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:35,616
This concept is something that you might need to play with and since it's so easy to change it you can just click a button

931
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:42,016
Here to compile your component install it look it it's behavior change it a little compile it install it

932
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:48,416
Look at it's behavior by doing that you'd get a good understanding of what What happens if you change these switches here

933
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,816
Ok now we said that we wanted the preachers name and stuff on the settings

934
00:37:55,072 --> 00:38:01,216
And our Tab for settings as the first have now we gonna look at the backend setup in

935
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:07,616
Off where you wanna have this Fields display now there are these different

936
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:14,016
Placing options left in tab right in tab full width in tab a

937
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:20,416
Above tab underneath tabs left of tabs right of tabs and then

938
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:26,816
There is the order in which it should go that means if we look at this again

939
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:33,216
This is left in tab this is right in tab I think I have

940
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:39,616
Another view that goes beyond some of those parameters let me go to this one

941
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:46,016
And we do question

942
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:52,416
So that is right off

943
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:58,816
Tab not in tab you see there is an option

944
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:11,616
It says Right in tab left in tab and then it says left of tabs and right

945
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:18,016
Of tabs now that means that you can put it out

946
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:24,416
Side of the tab area So even if I was to click here it will remain displayed right there on the side

947
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:30,816
And that is to put it a right of tab know there's also a left of tab area over here

948
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:37,216
Then a above tab is this one here that's above the tabs so it also shows all the time and

949
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:43,616
And then there's underneath tab so we basically added the option of

950
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:50,016
Placing data I just show you

951
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:56,416
At the right in tab left in tab and then right

952
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:02,816
Of right of tab and left of tab and above tab and beneath tab which is

953
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:09,216
1 2 3 4 5 6 positions in the backend of your

954
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:15,616
Template and the places are being set simply by these alignment assignments here

955
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:22,016
So select the field alignment inside the tab or view and you select these and

956
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:28,416
Then once you've selected them let's say you've selected left in like this one above tab and you select

957
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:34,816
1 then this is the order in which you wanted to display the first this one

958
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:41,216
Then that one left in tab this is first right in tab this one is first and then that one

959
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:47,616
And full width it is a description now full width will also this will always display

960
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:54,016
Under the left and right of in tab so you need to

961
00:40:54,272 --> 00:41:00,416
Select your left and right and then only your full width so full width his always the last

962
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:06,816
Thing to show up in a tab and then here is the switch to add permissions to

963
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:13,216
Is a specific values so if I was to say you know what I want the control

964
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:19,616
Which group can edit the name field you simply need to click this yes and that would

965
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
Add this field into the permissional structure dynamically and so that is how you

966
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:32,416
You control the permissions of fields that's how you add Fields to a view and those are

967
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,816
All the different switches now obviously you can only have one title per view and only have one

968
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:45,216
Allias per view so you should not have more than one selected and then in any case I think the system will

969
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
ignore the others but just to be safe let me tell you to set the others to know

970
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:58,015
And then those that are actually the title to yes and the one that's actually the allias to yes

971
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:04,415
And so we will be able to you know be sure to use the correct field values

972
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:10,815
And then when you set any of these to show you should set the order of their

973
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:17,215
Display here and ok so there is the filter the filter then is added dynamically

974
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,615
by Simply clicking a yes here so if we go to sermons as an example

975
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:30,015
And we click on their Fields they have many more fields which will help to illustrate some of these things

976
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:36,415
And you'd see that we have sermon series and we have it set up

977
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:42,815
As filter so filter is the second last column

978
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:49,215
Sermons series let's see we said that to yes so that means we can sort this

979
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:55,615
sermons by series that is how you set the filters for the backend remember this is primarily

980
00:42:55,871 --> 00:43:02,015
For the backend Although some of that information will relate to the front eventually especially this

981
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,415
Permissional Swiths will be able to access it from the front if you need to

982
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:14,815
But this is simply to add the fields to the actual

983
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:21,215
view in the backend ok if you have any questions

984
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:27,615
About this please give me a heads up if you feel like haven't done a good enough job explaining this then

985
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:34,015
Let me know and I'll redo this video so that's adding fields

986
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:40,415
To the admin views there are much more things to explain here and I think the only thing I'll still

987
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,815
Cover in this tutorial is the actual conditions this is an amazing feature

988
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:53,215
Which goes beyond Joomla's control on the show on attribute per

989
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:59,615
Field remember we looked at the show on attribute and the show on attribute can be control

990
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:06,015
can control which Fields to show when you are clicking on other

991
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:12,415
fields so for example here we have a field called

992
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:18,815
Add JavaScript if I click yes it opens this area Java

993
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:25,215
Script where I can add custom scripting now that behavior are being is being controlled

994
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:31,615
By this condition structure and the condition structure for sermons

995
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:38,015
Are the following if you can see there is a few already being set so what we will

996
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:44,415
As we are first decide which field are we targeting which field do we want to

997
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:50,815
Show or hide that's the behaviour do you wanna show a field or hide a field now most of the

998
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:57,215
Time we'll use show show means it'll be hidden unless these criteria's are met

999
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:03,615
So show is the one I use the most and I think most will use that mostly now here is the

1000
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:10,015
The list of all the fields in your system now you might say why don't you just show the fields that I've selected As part

1001
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:16,415
Of this view and unfortunately that feature isn't Place yet so you need to remember

1002
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,815
Which Fields you selected in the fields area and so for our purposes

1003
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:29,215
It's these Fields and you need to remember their names and then

1004
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,615
Then when you go to the conditions when you type a field like name

1005
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:42,015
You need to know oh it's this one that's how you would link to them now I've

1006
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:48,415
Build on option for files is a field and I wanted to show

1007
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:54,815
Now this isolate and chain function is a concept which I believe would

1008
00:45:55,071 --> 00:46:01,215
be best explained when you think about that not

1009
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:07,615
Only one field must start sorry be

1010
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:14,015
Used to show the other one but more than one field so in this case

1011
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:20,415
Dropbox Auto note in sermons should not only show when fields

1012
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:26,815
Source is Dropbox but also when built option is automatic

1013
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:33,215
So that both of these should be true before it shows

1014
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:39,615
The the Dropbox note and so you would select the field

1015
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:46,015
You want to control obviously you can control more than one at a time but the logic behind this

1016
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:52,415
Might not always work so you need to try it tested if it doesn't work come and tweak this until you

1017
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:58,815
you find it working in behaving the way you expect so most of the times

1018
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
You would only link one field to one validation

1019
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:11,615
But as soon as you have multiple Fields you use the chain option so it's either isolate like

1020
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:18,015
This one to build option of files should show when file source is Dropbox than it's

1021
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:24,415
Isolated it isn't connected to any of the other settings here as soon as you click chain

1022
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,815
It means any other field that has this any other row is a row that has this field selected

1023
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:37,215
as well we'll be chained together so that it must be both being validated

1024
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
as true before it actually will show the field so here let's look at it

1025
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:50,015
It says file source and you can select any of these if it if if you know that this file

1026
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:56,415
File this sorry file source is a list then you can look at ok this is a list and see the

1027
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,815
List options so this is only for text and it says that only for text Fields only for text fields

1028
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:09,215
If it's only for text fields only for text fields only for text fields this is only for list and radio and check

1029
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:15,615
Boxes and dynamic lists this is only for list radio and checkboxes this is only for list radio and checkboxes

1030
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:22,015
So and then you can say is or is not

1031
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:28,415
Sorry if it is Dropbox then it should show if it

1032
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:34,815
Is not Dropbox then it should show that is the the logic behind it

1033
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:41,215
Now here this one is when you're dealing with a dynamic list unfortunately with dynamic

1034
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:47,615
List it's quite difficult to set these values since they are dynamic

1035
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:54,015
And so the best way to deal with a dynamic would possibly be to leave this blank

1036
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
So that means that if any of the values are selected show show this item

1037
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
We will still look at Dynamic or custom fields

1038
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:13,215
Sorry Dynamic list all custom Fields and we will explain

1039
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:19,615
to you how to set up those custom Fields but that is basically what that option is for

1040
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:26,015
Most of the time we are using this is and we are when you select that specific

1041
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:32,415
Field and show you so if I select file source

1042
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
So you would select let's do that again if it if it is

1043
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:45,215
If the field that you've selected he's a text field the system will show you that by saying

1044
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:51,615
Keywords or length so you can say I want if he has put in a

1045
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:58,015
Length of 2 characters then show so then you take keywords away so

1046
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:04,415
So then that that's how you can use the text field now

1047
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:10,815
now you would Change this to

1048
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:17,215
Active that is active and that it has a length of 2

1049
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
That's how that that's what that would mean you if you know that what you've selected is a list it will show you the list

1050
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:30,015
But show you all the values and then you can remove the values that you don't want to use

1051
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:36,415
And the only value that's really important is that 2 the other side just for you so

1052
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:42,815
You could even just leave 2 that will be the same as that we are just showing you in

1053
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:49,215
in fact what I do is I explode the string at the pipe and I only use the first value to develop the

1054
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:55,615
The JavaScript in fact the Java Script that is being written we are in the sermons view

1055
00:50:55,871 --> 00:51:02,015
Let me show you that so we would go to

1056
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:08,415
Component Builder admin components

1057
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,815
Sermon distributor modules

1058
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:21,215
Forms and then you'd see there are two there's a XML which is the fields

1059
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:27,615
And then there is a js which is actually the Java Script so we open that and here's

1060
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:34,015
All the JavaScript that component Builder would build now if we look at this let's go there

1061
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:40,415
It's only these permissions sorry these

1062
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:46,815
A conditions ok so these are the conditions it's not even that long of a list

1063
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:53,215
But to implement these conditions component builder builds this

1064
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:59,615
JavaScript so it starts up here and all of this JavaScript is the

1065
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:06,015
Implementation of those things that we set there

1066
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:12,415
All the way down to there ok so that means about

1067
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:18,815
500 lines of JavaScript gets written by component builder just by these switches

1068
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:25,215
That you set up here now I'm showing you

1069
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:31,615
Where the script is being written so did once you've set up these switches you can come into this

1070
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:38,015
Script and if you remember the field name that you are working with

1071
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:44,415
So for example let's look at it build option is the field and files source

1072
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
So let's look if we can find that here

1073
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:57,215
There is source ok so it gets the value

1074
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:03,615
When the page is ready it checks the jform on this called source

1075
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:10,015
What is the value in it puts it in here and our first function obviously I'm using

1076
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:16,415
A random function name generator as you can see and it's

1077
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:22,815
Start with V and the next one would be VW and so on and so on and

1078
00:53:23,071 --> 00:53:29,215
Ok so that means you need to now to see how we implement this function hiding and

1079
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:35,615
Showing of the source you would search for the V function by

1080
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:42,015
just adding a bracket there and search ok so it's the first function

1081
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:48,415
And I'm basically saying is it set if it's set

1082
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:54,815
Then I I add a source constructor and if it's a

1083
00:53:55,071 --> 00:54:01,215
In array is this an array checking the value whether it's in array

1084
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:07,615
If it's not an array I put it into a temporary array here we go let me see

1085
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:14,015
There we push it into the temporal array

1086
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:20,415
And if it is an array and it isn't set we just create a blank array then

1087
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:26,815
We do a validation here and again this you can go check

1088
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:33,215
So basically the function is that one

1089
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:39,615
So let's check that function and all that function does is it checks is it 2

1090
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:46,015
If it's 2  it returns true if it's not 2 it returns false so you see it's quite simple

1091
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:52,415
And the value whether true or false is returned to source we put source into

1092
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,815
if its true then we close that View

1093
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:05,215
Sorry we get the closest class called

1094
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:11,615
Control group and we check is this field required if it's

1095
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:18,015
required and these are some homeworks that we do now if it's false then we hide it

1096
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:24,415
And there's also if it's required we do some house cleaning so that is simply

1097
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:30,815
Quick looking at the code which is being generated just by this one switch

1098
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:37,215
This is not the only code there is another place and that is in the

1099
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:43,615
view itself so we can go to view and then preacher no wait we are looking at sermon

1100
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:50,015
Then template and edit and then from around

1101
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:56,415
Here we have JavaScript again and again of a we have on

1102
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:02,815
Keyup for source or on change because I'm not at the system doesn't know is this a text field or

1103
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:09,215
Or is this a list field or what is it so we have these two check function on it and also

1104
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:15,615
Let me see

1105
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:22,015
There is another place where source is gonna be used for another

1106
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:28,415
Functions just focusing on this one and so it gets the value and it runs That Function

1107
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,815
Which is in our JavaScript file so here's the JavaScript file there is the function so it's reusing the same Function

1108
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:41,215
The moment that there is a key up or a change on that specific field so

1109
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:47,615
That's what I've done obviously other developers who are more advanced in JavaScript than I am get's

1110
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:54,015
Involved I could show them where in component builder The Script is being generated and we can

1111
00:56:54,271 --> 00:57:00,415
Improve this dramatically I am not that good at JavaScript and in fact I I feel like a

1112
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:06,815
Most probably a little bit resource-intensive here but this is the best I could do

1113
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:13,215
so far and obviously if we can improve it and if you know how to improve this then you

1114
00:57:13,471 --> 00:57:19,615
Welcome to get involved and GitHub and start with a discussion on improving this infrastructure

1115
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:26,015
I can tell you that this infrastructure is done in the compiler

1116
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
of course and I can show you exactly on which line This was developed you know built

1117
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:38,815
In fact all you need to do is when you compile your component just a if we

1118
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:45,215
Go back to components close this

1119
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:51,615
Ok here we're inside a component all you need to do to know where that is being built it's just tick this to yes

1120
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:58,015
And then it will add in the in the comments it will add a line

1121
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:04,415
Line reference of where that specific script is being built ok

1122
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:10,815
Let's go back to the admin views we're not really finished so this is

1123
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:17,215
Structure that you can use to actually manipulate the conditions upon which field should show or not show

1124
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:23,615
And I I really think we have done a very good implementation here

1125
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:30,015
It gives you so much of its possibilities of structuring and training and

1126
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:36,415
Working with fields in its relationships if you want to not use this and just

1127
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:42,815
Use the on show then that is also gonna work just as well if fact I think it will work better the only problem on

1128
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:49,215
Show is that it doesn't actually provide the ability to target as

1129
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:55,615
A text field like we have here where you can add a keyword and say OK if they if it types in his for example

1130
00:58:55,871 --> 00:59:02,015
then immediately this other field will show up which is it

1131
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:08,415
Excellent feature I mean I don't think you can get that kind of intricacy with

1132
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:14,815
With the show on option and furthermore It cannot look at multiple other fields

1133
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:21,215
If they have certain values and if it evaluates true then only show the other field

1134
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:27,615
Those kind of controls are not yet available in the show on implementation as far as I know and

1135
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:34,015
Yes I possibly would like to get involved on the get repo of Joomla and see

1136
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:40,415
If we can add these nice features but for now we have add them to Component Builder

1137
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:46,815
And in component builder you can implement these and we are writing the JavaScript to manage this

1138
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:53,215
For you ok so that is your conditions for fields

1139
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:59,615
So we've looked at all of these the next one is basically the list of the fields that you have already

1140
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:06,015
selected and click save you will show a list of all the fields that you've selected again any of those

1141
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:12,415
Fields if you wanna update them you could just click on the field name in all take you to the field and you can update it

1142
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:18,815
The Next tab is a place for you to add custom CSS that is just related to the specific

1143
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:25,215
View so you can add CSS here which is for the edit view or the

1144
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:31,615
Single View and you can add CSS here which is for the listview or the

1145
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:38,015
Multiple views plural and then it will be

1146
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:44,415
Placed in his prospective places the same goes with the JavaScript accept that you have four

1147
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:50,815
Places to Target instead of just one if remember we when we looked at the way that we are

1148
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:57,215
The building the JavaScript there is a file a JavaScript file which just has JavaScript

1149
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:03,615
For the view and then there is the footer area which is under the HTML and PHP

1150
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
At the end of the file there is a whole area which is just JavaScript at the footer of the file

1151
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:16,415
And so we decided to add the option of adding JavaScript to the file

1152
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:22,815
Or JavaScript to the footer of the view or the file sorry the view file or the view footer or

1153
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:29,215
Views file or the views footer so it just gives you the option of targeting

1154
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:35,615
You now listen this script can run is a function and I just wanted to be able to be on the page

1155
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:42,015
Then you add it to the file and then if you wanna use the function you can add it to the footer that

1156
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:48,415
it's up to you Ok then there is a PHP area and here you have the option of adding

1157
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:54,815
Adding JavaScript to your editing View

1158
01:01:55,071 --> 01:02:01,215
Primarily so if we look at editing views the moment you click on

1159
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:07,615
Add JavaScript it opens a tab and now the way that we want to implement 

1160
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:14,015
 Ajax is Primarily

1161
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:20,415
Via the controller and method implementation

1162
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:26,815
So if I explain that to you the component has a controller called Ajax

1163
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:33,215
Dot Json PHP you can open there

1164
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:39,615
Then it has a model

1165
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:46,015
But we just called Ajax ok so you have a controller and you have a model now the controller is 

1166
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:52,415
Like the gatekeeper he first does a few checks and balances to ensure that the data is

1167
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:58,815
Correct that that the token is right that if you have set this to be

1168
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:05,215
Validating whether he is a user then it also checks that there's a user ID

1169
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:11,615
If you have said it that it doesn't require them to be a user it basically would drop off this validation I will show you that

1170
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:18,015
in a moment so that you can follow me

1171
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:24,415
 there is a controller area and then there's some model area and the model is

1172
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:30,815
Basically a place where you can write a method

1173
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:37,215
Which is queried from the controller so you can see in the controller it basically is getting the

1174
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:43,615
Ajax model and then it is querying a method in that model called Dropbox so here

1175
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:50,015
We are querying the Dropbox method and it's getting the view

1176
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:56,415
Name there it seems that I'm

1177
01:03:56,671 --> 01:04:02,815
I'm not even really using it just make sure the moment I'm not in

1178
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:09,215
Even using this variable but it's none the less it is here and I possibly will use it later

1179
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:15,615
If it becomes necessary so I'm basically just activating this method to run

1180
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:22,015
And when this method runs it Triggers some Global methods to run and

1181
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:28,415
On the return of that value it Triggers another local method so again I'm not

1182
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:34,815
Trying to teach you PHP here all I want to show us that this part of

1183
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:41,215
The code was custom written so if we go back to our component you'd see that there is that code

1184
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,615
So when you click on Ajax you add that name

1185
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:54,015
Basically writing a method make sure that it's set to public and your write your

1186
01:04:54,271 --> 01:05:00,415
 method in here and in the in Ajax input you would say ok listen that

1187
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:06,815
 the Task name is check Dropbox this thing the values I want to pass it is view and

1188
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:13,215
Type and both of them are integers and it

1189
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,615
Needs to run the view needs to run a Dropbox method

1190
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:26,015
And the type needs to run an update dropbox and both of them should check wither it

1191
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:32,415
is a user so only users can fire This back end methods and the

1192
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,207
You can see that you have control to tick that

1193
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
Obviously the

1194
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
Filters are

1195
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,119
The same as with

1196
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:42,143
Any field

1197
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:43,423
that you can select

1198
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:48,799
And so integer here would be fine and if there's no value you said nil

1199
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,591
This task name

1200
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,639
Is what you be using in your JavaScript

1201
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:54,175
So

1202
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,991
I first wanted to show you the PSP side

1203
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,575
And then the task name itself ok so let's just

1204
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,599
Make sure I do not miscommunicate here

1205
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,927
The method name

1206
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
is set here

1207
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,487
And that should correspond

1208
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,255
To the method

1209
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:10,047
That you set up in your

1210
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Ajax method

1211
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,351
PHP Ajax method

1212
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:17,727
Which is possibly the method in which model the data, get  the data

1213
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,799
Structure the data and give it back to the Ajax call

1214
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,103
So you return the data

1215
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
Inside of this method

1216
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,479
But in your JavaScript you will be using the task name

1217
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:29,503
to

1218
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
To get

1219
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,295
to the 

1220
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
System

1221
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,367
So if we go to the JavaScript close out

1222
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
go JavaScript

1223
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:51,263
What it seems I used the JavaScript example which is gonna get

1224
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,799
Way ahead of us

1225
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
But

1226
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
Since we started Let me not leave you and mid air

1227
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,711
So I like I'll have to close out here

1228
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,247
And I'm going

1229
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:04,831
Quite ahead of myself now but I need to otherwise you'll feel very lost

1230
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
In summer distributor

1231
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,719
Which is the component to which that view belongs

1232
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,791
There is a place called Scripts

1233
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
And

1234
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
I have added a feature

1235
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,423
Which is called

1236
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
Chronic

1237
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,007
Global

1238
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
Events

1239
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:26,591
So

1240
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,663
I have added a feature

1241
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,711
To add Global events

1242
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,039
Now Global events or the way I

1243
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:36,063
am implementing it

1244
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,135
Is simply an event that should run every time

1245
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:39,903
A page opens

1246
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,535
Anytime any page in the system opens I wanted it to run the global event

1247
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:49,887
Now the way I target it is I say load Dropbox Ajax

1248
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,423
Ok

1249
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,447
It's a

1250
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
 global event and it

1251
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,287
Needs to do that

1252
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,591
And The Drop Box Ajax

1253
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,127
Is basically

1254
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,919
Set up in the

1255
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,711
Helper class

1256
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
So I have a helper class

1257
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,599
Which is called load Dropbox Ajax and it gets the document object

1258
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:15,487
it takes the job document object  it adds a script declaration

1259
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:17,535
to it And here is the JavaScript

1260
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,559
That it is adding

1261
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
And you see

1262
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:24,447
That in that it is using check Dropbox listing

1263
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
As the 

1264
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Task

1265
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,055
So it's targeting

1266
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
The

1267
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:31,103
Ajax

1268
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,151
Controller

1269
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
And asking

1270
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,503
for check Dropbox listing

1271
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,527
As the task

1272
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,319
And it's passing to it

1273
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
A token

1274
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,647
And the view name

1275
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,743
So possibly we would like to use that View

1276
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
ID later

1277
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:51,839
to log from which area this automated

1278
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
Feature mostly gets

1279
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,631
Triggered

1280
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:55,167
I'm not doing that as yet

1281
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
So

1282
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,495
This is just what the script will do

1283
01:08:59,007 --> 01:08:59,519
So there is 

1284
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:01,055
j Query

1285
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,615
Which only fired after page is loaded

1286
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,943
And at the moment it's just adding a dummy 3 in there

1287
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,735
to just trigger the method

1288
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,295
And so

1289
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:17,951
That is really how this script ends up on the page and I'm sorry that I used that as an example

1290
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,487
I realise it's

1291
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,511
A little bit

1292
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
Ahead of ourselves

1293
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
But

1294
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,119
Nonetheless I I want to

1295
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,679
Not leave it at a loose end

1296
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,471
So I

1297
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Redoing it actually for you

1298
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,823
That is where this PHP

1299
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,871
Script really gonna be used

1300
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:40,223
So since I need to add this somewhere I just selected a view and that

1301
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,271
to Advantage it to this sermon view

1302
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:47,391
And I added the Ajax control the concepts here

1303
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,719
But the actual JavaScript that fires off all this

1304
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,255
Is set to the global

1305
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,071
Event and that means every time a back end 

1306
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,143
Area is opened

1307
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,191
In this component

1308
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:03,263
It loads that JavaScript to the view

1309
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:08,127
And a JavaScript execute Ajax request which starts updating the Dropbox listing

1310
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:12,735
Now I'm not gonna explain all of that Dropbox listening to you now it's a

1311
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:14,271
quite an advance concept

1312
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
But it's basically

1313
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:19,135
Sermon distributor is able to link two

1314
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,159
Dropbox sermons

1315
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Oh sorry

1316
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,511
 a media inside of a shared Dropbox folder

1317
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:27,839
And this whole method here that be looking at

1318
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:29,119
Parses that

1319
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,911
Dropbox folder every so often

1320
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:32,191
To make sure that it's

1321
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
To date

1322
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
That's what it's all about

1323
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,335
So that is just looking at adding Ajax

1324
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,127
You can see that

1325
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
If you know

1326
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,943
The Joomla API

1327
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:45,503
You know that it has a get item

1328
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,271
Method

1329
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,343
It has a get items method in the

1330
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:51,647
In the model

1331
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,951
So in the model there's a get item method

1332
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,071
In the editing model and in the list model there is a get items method

1333
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:03,167
Then there's a get list query in the Jay model list

1334
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,959
And there is a safe method

1335
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:07,007
There's a post safe method

1336
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,543
In the in the controller

1337
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,335
Is allowed at

1338
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,615
Edit method

1339
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,407
There's a batch copy method

1340
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,247
There's a batch move method there's a script before edit

1341
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
Sorry before delete

1342
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Method

1343
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
There's a script

1344
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
After delete

1345
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:28,255
And these are all PHP places in which you can dump custom scripting

1346
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,327
So you wanna in the safe method

1347
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
Now

1348
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,119
Obviously again

1349
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,655
You need to know where the safe method is

1350
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,703
It is so if I would open

1351
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:39,007
Sermon here

1352
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Scroll down

1353
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,663
Ok so there's the get item

1354
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:50,271
So you can add custom scripting to the get item method

1355
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,343
and if I Scroll down

1356
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
There's the batch

1357
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:04,863
That's copy

1358
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
batchmove

1359
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
There is a safe method

1360
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:13,823
And so if we go back here and we click on the safe method

1361
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,127
It says here

1362
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,919
That should run

1363
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:20,991
PHP year that should run in the safe method

1364
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:22,783
And then

1365
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
You have the data

1366
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,111
it's a array

1367
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
And it's called

1368
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
Data

1369
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
So

1370
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,719
If you look here

1371
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
It means

1372
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,791
You're able to Target that

1373
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:35,327
Value

1374
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,607
The gets placed into

1375
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,375
Save

1376
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
Ok

1377
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,359
And I am sure that your custom

1378
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,383
Value

1379
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
Code

1380
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:53,759
Will be placed in before the parents saved

1381
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,295
But if you do not

1382
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,599
If you do not know in any of those

1383
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,391
Custom scripts

1384
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:01,183
Where that code will be set

1385
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,463
What you can do

1386
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
is just type

1387
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:06,047
It is

1388
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:06,815
Loaded

1389
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
Here

1390
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,727
And then compile save it and compile the component and then go look at the code

1391
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,775
And you see where it is showing up

1392
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:17,311
And then you can add

1393
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,871
Ok I've got all these values already

1394
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:21,407
In the script

1395
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:25,247
Because all that component builder is gonna do it's just gonna

1396
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:27,039
Let's say

1397
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:31,135
It will just say

1398
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,559
That's that's how it will look

1399
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:45,215
It'll just add to string so when the component itself runs it will treated as code

1400
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:47,775
This is a comment but I mean if it was code

1401
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
You just execute

1402
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:52,639
So it is the way for you to add custom scripting

1403
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,919
Right into your component

1404
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,991
Almost anywhere really

1405
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
You are able to Target

1406
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Through these switches

1407
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,439
The post save hook

1408
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:07,743
Is actually in the controller not in the model

1409
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
So

1410
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:09,791
You go to the 

1411
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,815
controller

1412
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,095
Sermon

1413
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
Scroll to the bottom

1414
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,727
And you see there is a post save hook

1415
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:22,847
And it basically gives you the model and it gives you the valid data and you can

1416
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:23,615
Actually

1417
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,151
can perform extra features on it

1418
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:29,247
But in all these things

1419
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,295
You you should just read

1420
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:36,927
 the description here it says PHP here that should run in the post Save hook method

1421
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:43,327
And there's the object model is the data model Object and the erased validator is the validator

1422
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:47,935
So if you just read our little note here

1423
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:49,471
Then you can start coding

1424
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,239
For it

1425
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,263
Ok

1426
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,567
That is so adding custom scripting

1427
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,591
To the view

1428
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,919
Basically the list view as well as the

1429
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:58,943
Each View

1430
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,271
And then the MySQL dump area

1431
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,807
Which we looked at earlier

1432
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:06,111
You can do two kinds of dumps now

1433
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,647
What is this used mostly for

1434
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:10,207
Well what I found while I was

1435
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,487
Busy developing

1436
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
That I would be

1437
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,815
Busy setting up a component

1438
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:19,423
and install it and then add dummy data to it to see if it works

1439
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,983
And then every time I make a change

1440
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,311
And I uninstall that component and install the new one

1441
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:28,127
Because whatever change it made to the database

1442
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,151
Won't be

1443
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:32,223
You're not added to the database via an update

1444
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,271
You need to uninstall the component and install it again

1445
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:36,831
To get the database back to where you want it

1446
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,903
And so

1447
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:42,975
 the only way I could do save myself

1448
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
Time

1449
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,791
Is to actually say listen I'm gonna

1450
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:51,935
Re-install this component and the dummy data for sermons I would like to retain

1451
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,983
And so I would go table

1452
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:57,567
 and I Open the tables it will show me a list of all the

1453
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:00,127
Tables that are in the database at that moment

1454
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:00,895
And then

1455
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:02,943
I would scroll to sermon

1456
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,735
the Sermon table

1457
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:06,271
click on it

1458
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
And it will load

1459
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,855
The table and

1460
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:11,135
What it should be called

1461
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:13,439
In the data set

1462
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:16,511
Here is some explanation if you want to do

1463
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,815
Other tables so let's say you wanna

1464
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:23,423
have it mapped to multiple tables then this is the explanation on how to

1465
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Do that

1466
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,287
I would not recommend doing this because possibly

1467
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
You will not get

1468
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,359
What you expect

1469
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,407
And so

1470
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:36,991
Just going with the values that it populates for you

1471
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,783
will Possibly your best call

1472
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,087
Unless those values change

1473
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:44,159
And if you are making changes adding new fields

1474
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:49,023
You must realise that you need to come and reset this by clicking on something else

1475
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,815
And then clicking on it again

1476
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,863
And that it loads the new

1477
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:55,167


1478
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:57,727


1479
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,495
 list

1480
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:02,079
of Fields that are related to this table

1481
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,615
To this

1482
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
Back end view Table

1483
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,199
And that way

1484
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,015
When you compile the component

1485
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:13,343
then component builder will actually grab the data

1486
01:17:13,599 --> 01:17:16,671
From the database and build a dump file for you

1487
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:18,463
Now that is one way of doing it

1488
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,767
I might be a little bit complex but it is saved

1489
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,047
Tons of hours

1490
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,119
The other way would be to just do a dump file itself

1491
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
So you'd go to

1492
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,167
Your

1493
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,239
Your MySQL

1494
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,031
you would open the specific

1495
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,311
 let's Use this thing

1496
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,591
that is Smaller

1497
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,175
Field types

1498
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,015
And you click on

1499
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:43,039
Export

1500
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,343
And then you would select

1501
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,623
A sequel format

1502
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:48,159
And click go

1503
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,975
And this will create a dump file

1504
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,535
Of all the data in the table

1505
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,351
And you can basically

1506
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,679
Paste that dump file in here

1507
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:00,703
Now

1508
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,367
I was looking at

1509
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
Important

1510
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,487
So you click export

1511
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:24,511
click quick

1512
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,815
Then SQL and then Go

1513
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,863
And then just save it

1514
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:31,935
Then

1515
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,239
Go to that file

1516
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,543
Open it

1517
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:40,639
And having it open

1518
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,431
You just replace

1519
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
This

1520
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,479
String

1521
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:46,783
With

1522
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,343
Hash

1523
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:50,879
Underscore

1524
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,951
So and then replace all

1525
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:57,023
And you will not use the table

1526
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,839
Structure because that is already in component builder

1527
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,167
You just use

1528
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,703
This area here

1529
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:07,007
Basically you would copy

1530
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:08,543
this Area

1531
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,175
like That

1532
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,199
Cut

1533
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
Come here

1534
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
paste

1535
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,903
And click save

1536
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:34,143
And that will mean that you have to dump file

1537
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,191
And it will always be added 

1538
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,215
To your new

1539
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Install

1540
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:41,311
If a dump file is way too big

1541
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:44,895
You will see it by just after your clicked save come and look

1542
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,919
At the end

1543
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
And see if it cut it off somewhere

1544
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,759
So let's say

1545
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,831
 it cut it off there that I know my dumb file is

1546
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:54,367
To big for the 

1547
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
use

1548
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
Structure

1549
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,959
For your dump

1550
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,727
File

1551
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:16,384
I used medium text

1552
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:23,040
let's see medium text

1553
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,320
Here

1554
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
Prosafe

1555
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:30,976
There it is

1556
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,120
Sequel

1557
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,912
I used medium text

1558
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
So that means

1559
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:40,960
It's quite big

1560
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,032
You can really put a lot of

1561
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,312
Text inside of it

1562
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:48,128
You wanna know exactly how much just Google it

1563
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,176
and you will see

1564
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,712
I'm gonna remove this obviously

1565
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,248
 because It's not related

1566
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,808
to sermons at all

1567
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,576
And

1568
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,856
In fact I'm not even go to use

1569
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
the dump here, save and close

1570
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
Ok

1571
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,304
That is basically setting up an admin View

1572
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:09,632
I know I've run around and it seemed

1573
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,168
quite hectic

1574
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,008
And I possibly will redo this video at a certain stage

1575
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
Try to be

1576
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,312
Structured

1577
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,128
But I think it is informative enough

1578
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:20,896
And

1579
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
if you

1580
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,968
Have any questions please email me

1581
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:24,992
and I will

1582
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,528
Try to communicate with you

1583
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
And if I see that a certain question comes up often enough

1584
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,136
I will add it to the

1585
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,160
Video

1586
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,440
Possibly redoing

1587
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
Specific area

1588
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
Admin views

1589
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,024
is quite intense

1590
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,096
And we will possibly revisit many of the

1591
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,120
Concepts that we have looked at today

1592
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,448
Thank you for watching
