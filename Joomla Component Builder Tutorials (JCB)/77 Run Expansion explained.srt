1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:02,304
I'd like to explain a

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,840
New feature or

3
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,376
An old feature that is

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
been revived

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:08,192
Somehow

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,056
In JCB. The feature is now visible

7
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,336
On many of the

8
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:15,360
The pages

9
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:16,640
It's called

10
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Run expansion

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,224
Now

12
00:00:20,736 --> 00:00:21,760
I realize that

13
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:26,880
When you would click on this at the moment

14
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,416
It'll give you an error

15
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:32,000
And it will tell you the expansion failed

16
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,792
Please check your settings

17
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:35,072
in the Global options

18
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:39,424
Of JCB under the development tab

19
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:42,752
So you need to basically open these

20
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,544
Global options

21
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
And under the development tab

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,640
You need to read

23
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:49,920
Some of this

24
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:50,688
Instructions

25
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,736
So

26
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,320
Development method tab has

27
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,392
Now there's new switch called expansion

28
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,280
And here is basically the documentation on what expansion is all about

29
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:12,192
Really what has happened in my developing experience

30
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
Is that

31
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
We build

32
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:19,872
Multiple components that have a relationship with each other

33
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
Share classes

34
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
Share code

35
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
And files and

36
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,624
While you busy working on those components

37
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,648
You need to

38
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
often times

39
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:36,512
Basically compile and install them

40
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,632
To test whether Things have broken or everything still stable and so forth

41
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,168
So

42
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
That's what I use the expansion method primarily for but

43
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:54,432
There is a future application of the expansion method

44
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
Which is not yet been fully realized

45
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,016
And

46
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,344
When we are able to bring

47
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,880
All of that to the

48
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,464
To the to the community then I'll make

49
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
another tutorial in explaining

50
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:12,864
There you know the expansion of expansion

51
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
Might be too much but

52
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:20,544
For now the expansion method is primarily an option

53
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,384
Of selecting multiple components you can see here

54
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
You can select

55
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
Multiple

56
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,480
Components

57
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
And

58
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:34,880
Then have them compiled and installed

59
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,416
At once

60
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,464
And quite

61
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,768
Rapidly actually

62
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,560
So you could

63
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,632
You could say ok I want all of these

64
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,656
Components

65
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
To be moved

66
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960
To The Back-up folder

67
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,264
And

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
To repository

69
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Folder

70
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,080
And

71
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,616
Show The custom placeholder

72
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,176
And give me a message

73
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
Not just that it was successful but

74
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,528
Everything which was done

75
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,088
You could have this run on a cron job

76
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
Which means

77
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
It keeps on running in the background

78
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:14,816
Always compiling and installing this over and over and over and

79
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
That is part of

80
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:20,192
If we If our feature purpose or plans come to pass

81
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:22,240
Then you would see why this

82
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
Was actually

83
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,056
Necessary

84
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,104
So this point is maybe in doesn't make

85
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,480
That much of sense but for

86
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:35,808
The previous implementation which is what you see here

87
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,904
Is to basically just

88
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
Install and compile

89
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
Multiple

90
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Different

91
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,328
Components select the same

92
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
Different components

93
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,800
So we would do this it's gonna ask that

94
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Ok there we go save and

95
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,384
Close

96
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,968
So now we have our expansion components selected

97
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,784
If I now click run expansion

98
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,832
It says access denied

99
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
And

100
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:11,648
That is because

101
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
The expansion works through the API

102
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,768
There is a

103
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,143
well slowly we are busy developing an API for JCB

104
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,703
It's not fully there yet but

105
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:28,287
You know we were busy with it and in the API

106
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:31,359
We need to actually

107
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:34,431
Have a user selected that has

108
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Enough permission

109
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,271
to actually compile and install components

110
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,063
So you need to select

111
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,855
A user that has that

112
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Level of permission

113
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,743
I ask the API user used during the execution

114
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
Of the

115
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,047
Of the

116
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Expansion

117
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,583
Method

118
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
Ok so let's try again

119
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
If we now

120
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:55,935
Do that

121
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,775
If you think about how long it would have taken to install

122
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,335
Compile and install compile and it's

123
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
install compile install

124
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,151
Each of those

125
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,687
Components

126
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:07,711
Individually

127
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,479
And

128
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,015
The time that it now

129
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:12,063
Took to compile it and in

130
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:12,831
Install it

131
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,855
There is a

132
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,391
Somewhat of a difference

133
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,279
And the fact that it doesn't give you the option to download the package

134
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
it immediately after compiling it

135
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,655
Actually installs it and removes it from the temporary

136
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
folder so you can see

137
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,751
it tells you that all of that

138
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:31,519
It's been done for

139
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,799
This component

140
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:35,359
For that one and so forth all the way down here

141
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:39,199
So all these components now who compiled and installed

142
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,759
Right into the system in that moment

143
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
And that's really at the moment

144
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:48,415
What the expansion method is primarily used for

145
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,719
like I said we have

146
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
Some

147
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:54,815
Future plans with this preacher

148
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:58,399
When it comes to integrator developing

149
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,471
Concepts where we as teams work together

150
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:04,543
Then there is the possibility that

151
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
We could

152
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,639
Use this feature

153
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,943
Even further

154
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
Ok so that is the expansion method hope this makes

155
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,367
Sense

156
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,159
I mean if you don't like it or you don't

157
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,463
See the need for a it

158
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
Just ignore it

159
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
Even if you did set it

160
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:31,423
To use the expansion method It only means that your expansion buttons

161
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,215
Will function when you click them

162
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,519
By Default

163
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:38,847
JCB ships with the expansion method

164
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
On

165
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,663
In inactive

166
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
So that if someone clicks here by accident

167
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,623
It will tell you that the expansion method is disabled and it you should actually

168
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,415
Enable it for it to work

169
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,487
And I mean that also makes sense right because

170
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:00,607
You don't want the expansion method to trigger Without You Knowing why and what it's doing.

171
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:04,191
Ok well thanks for watching

172
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:04,959
Until next time.
