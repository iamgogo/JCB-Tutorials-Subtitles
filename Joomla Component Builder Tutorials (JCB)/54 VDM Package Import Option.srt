1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:02,048
Great news

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:05,888
I think the option that we've

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:11,264
Put in place especially for those of you that have really purchase some JCB packages

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,800
Like the demo

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:16,384
Advanced demo component or the Sermon distributor component

6
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,968
This will be excellent news so let me demonstrate what we've

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,736
Done

8
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:23,040
And also makes suggestions

9
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:23,808
Of future

10
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:24,576
Changes

11
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,904
On the import components area now

12
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
There is an extra tab

13
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,792
And with this tab you can now easily

14
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
Import

15
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:38,144
Paid or free

16
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Components

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,192
That

18
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:40,960
We actually

19
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:41,984
distribute.

20
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
It's called the VDM packages so it took of moment to load it it does take a while because

21
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:50,432
it actually queries

22
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,992
At the moment it queries GitHub

23
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,064
And check and gets a list of all the latest packages

24
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:56,832
So if we

25
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,392
You know updated GitHub it will automatically

26
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:01,440
show then the new packages

27
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:02,208
Here

28
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:02,976
So

29
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,792
And we will be adding more free options

30
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:10,912
I, we are planning to to add some more free packages here the moment there is only 2

31
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:13,728
To really most of them are paid

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
So you could

33
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,848
You can buy any of these packages and use it

34
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,640
in anyway you like

35
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
So

36
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,224
The Hello World is free and the demo version

37
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
here is free but you could, yes you can actually get any of these and if you

38
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,208
You're ready purchased a sermon distributor version

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
 you can just select

40
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,512
it here

41
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:39,584
Because you know JCB is constantly improving

42
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
And so Sermon Distributor

43
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,400
is also improving

44
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
And so we making changes to

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:51,104
To sermon distributor and if you wanna update yours or even if you have played with it and you wanna reset it

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
But know remember

47
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:55,968
If you got a reset it it will reset everything in

48
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:58,016
Including every field and even

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:58,784
Field types

50
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,320
So

51
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,344
Do

52
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,624
Keep that in mind

53
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
That if you

54
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
install this package

55
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Over the existing

56
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
one

57
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
It will revert everything

58
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Back what is great though

59
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:11,840
Is that Joomla obviously keeps

60
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
history right

61
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:19,520
If you put your history on for the JCB component so that means you could actually take a step back and some of those every

62
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,544
If you want it

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
Anyway that's just a little

64
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:28,736
Side note so you basically select the package you want to install and then click on get package

65
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,392
This will take a while as it's downloading it from GitHub please make sure to read all these things I didn't even now

66
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
Trough that but

67
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
you should read

68
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,512
All of these packages are fully you know all that

69
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:41,792
Is written there

70
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,352
So you end up at the page which

71
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:46,144
We usually would

72
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,704
Shows you who made the package

73
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
If you still didn't get the

74
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:50,752
key

75
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,032
you could click on this link here

76
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,312
To actually go buy the key

77
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
And get it

78
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
For any of the other packages

79
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
as well

80
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,736
Or before getting here there's a there's a link

81
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,552
That says By packages you could also click on those and then

82
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,088
select the package you like

83
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,416
Here it'll show you the component that is actually being in

84
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
Stalled

85
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
which is says here is sermon

86
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
Distributor

87
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,328
2.0 2.0.2

88
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,376
Which is the latest version

89
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
And

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
You then add your key here

91
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,752
Which I will do in a moment

92
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
And then click continue

93
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:26,592
Which then makes it

94
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,872
Install

95
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
We added this new switch here quiet

96
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,712
And some of your

97
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,480


98
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,064
Releases that might be a spelling mistake like 

99
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:36,832
This one here which is Quite

100
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,160
But we fixed it and

101
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,440
We did push out

102
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,464
The the fix

103
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,232
For this

104
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:45,280
Which means in

105
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,840
JCB 7.8.1

106
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Possibly

107
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,168
2.7.

108
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:53,728
O oh sorry 2.7.1

109
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,520
Come on

110
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:58,592
We'll have this typo fixed

111
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:01,152
Anyway what this does

112
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:06,016
Is it give the option to see exactly everything it does JCBs

113
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
Importing on the package

114
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,136
So the actually tells you what ID was changed to what ID

115
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:16,256
It doesn't give you the names just give you ID references so gives you a lot of more

116
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Sort of insight of what happened

117
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:25,727
Which is obviously used for when something doesn't go right you could click on this so usually it's set to quiet

118
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:31,871
you don't really wanna see all that detail you just want to know it's done but if you wanna see the detail you basically

119
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639
click yes

120
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
And here if you want to overwrite existing

121
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Data

122
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,807
You see how the force location update works

123
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
Is if it finds an item

124
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,671
And that item is

125
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:45,951
Newer

126
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,743
Then the one

127
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
That is

128
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
Being imported then it

129
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,863
Drops the import option

130
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
And it keeps the newer version in your system

131
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:02,847
So if you click here that's how usually works with the force local update to 

132
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
No if you change this to

133
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,407
Yes

134
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:08,479
Then it will ignore the time stamp completely

135
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:13,855
And update the item irrespective whether it is newer or older or whatever

136
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,135
Ok so that's that

137
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,695
So we're at the ID and then we click

138
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
Continue

139
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
I'm gonna pause the video from home as you want to see the ID

140
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
And there you have it

141
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:27,679
So it gave me a very detailed

142
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,287
Print out so when it didn't find when it founded

143
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
It says it founded and then it updated it

144
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:40,991
But if it didn't find it it will actually say that ID so and so in field

145
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,295
Was changed to ID so and so

146
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,063
And it's been

147
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,367
Imported so there is the list

148
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,135
Of everything he

149
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,159
Did

150
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,719
Yeah it's quite a long list

151
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
I'm Scrolling

152
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
I'm Scrolling

153
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:57,375
Ok and then the bottom it says great if that's what you would usually see

154
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Just that

155
00:05:58,911 --> 00:05:59,423
So

156
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,703
All of The Rest

157
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:01,727
It actually just

158
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Showed you because we ticked it

159
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:09,663
Not to be quiet so now was Sermon Distributor imported

160
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,711
Now you can open at look at it

161
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,735
Basically it's

162
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
Should have all the data here

163
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
The licensing might have changed so just add another licence here and then

164
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Save and

165
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Close

166
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,839
And then you can actually compile it as easy as that

167
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:29,631
So Sermon Distributor

168
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,167
click compile

169
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
And

170
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:38,847
Then once it's compiled obviously then you have the Joomla package so what this does

171
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,687
It also included the

172
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,735
The external script with

173
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
Is also the sort of a

174
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Demonstration of actually

175
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:47,807
The adding external scripts

176
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,647
So it's grabbing it from GitHub.  You can go and look at that.

177
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,255
It is simply a script that checks

178
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
For mime types

179
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,863
And it tells you that first time very 

180
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
Detailed in there after you only see

181
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
This

182
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,495
And only if it changes when will you see

183
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,775
Something like that again

184
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,103
Ok so you can click here on install

185
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,943
And now if you go to components there it is Sermon Distributor

186
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
Fully mapped

187
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:20,831
Well all functional

188
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
JCB

189
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:28,511
Has Built This by importing it first from our GitHub repository and

190
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:30,559
then you're able to adapt it and

191
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
Use it in

192
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,095
Anywhere you like

193
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,167
Anyway yeah that is the

194
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:37,983
The new feature I wanted to sort of demonstrate

195
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
I hope you like it

196
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:44,383
What the suggestion is at the moment we can

197
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Just go back there for a moment

198
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
Importing components

199
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,319
The suggestion is to have even a 5th tab

200
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:53,599
So there will be

201
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,159
This tab VDM packages and then a

202
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,439
Community tab

203
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,719
like over here

204
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,255
Which

205
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,559
Those of you in the community

206
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Good one to share

207
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,863
Free

208
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,423
Components

209
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:09,471
We could add that in here

210
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,799
And we still thinking about the paid

211
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
You know share sharing paid components

212
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:18,175
Yeah we still think about how that could

213
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Work

214
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:23,039
Of course at the moment it shouldn't become

215
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:26,879
Too complicated because if you if you

216
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,903
click on anything

217
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
And then click get package

218
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
That package

219
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
It's has it

220
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Internal

221
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,303
The variables

222
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,839
Which actually

223
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,631
decides the

224
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
What this values going to

225
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,679
Be right

226
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
So if we would 

227
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,775
Click this value

228
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
It takes you to my shop

229
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,615
Where you then purchase that

230
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
specific product

231
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,455
Ok

232
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,223
So

233
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,271
That is a valued

234
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,551
Determined by the package

235
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:01,439
Which means it shouldn't be that hard for us to actually include paid options paid components

236
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,535
What is a little bit of a challenge

237
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:12,191
Is whether JCB should actually ask for a little bit of a

238
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:14,495
Yeah contribution

239
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,823
To support a project in this

240
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,359
Way

241
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:25,759
so we still discussing that anyway anyone have a suggestions please post it here at the bottom of the

242
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Video make comments

243
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Tell me what you think

244
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:30,879
The end of day

245
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
We wanna make sure that the community

246
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
can use this

247
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:35,487
In long run that it becomes

248
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
a nice tool

249
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,607
I'm even thinking of moving this option this whole getting to

250
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,887
Importing of components

251
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,447
To an actual tab

252
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,495
On the desk

253
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,775
on the dashboard

254
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:51,359
So you can get to this page without having to first go to

255
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,383
Components and then

256
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Click through here

257
00:09:54,175 --> 00:10:00,319
So there is even that kind of discussion but just for now we wanted to demonstrate the new feature it's

258
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,343


259
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
It's actually been able to 

260
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
do that already

261
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,975
We just didn't have that extra tab but you could have copied

262
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,303
The links to those packages on

263
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:14,655
GitHub and have imported them that way that's

264
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
Should basically what

265
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,287
what the ReadMe files would have shown you if you purchase any of these keys. Ok well thank for watching again. and speak to you again.
