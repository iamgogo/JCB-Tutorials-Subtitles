1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:02,816
I would like to give a

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
And demonstration and maybe some explanation around how the functionality of a

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:15,872
Custom field works I think we've had some tutorials about this in the past

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,920
But it

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,992
JCB has improved

6
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,528
And there is

7
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:25,344
a little bit of a different look

8
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,624
to that area

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
So let me

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,744
Let me do this again and maybe I'll even try and

11
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,768
give some code

12
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:34,304
I mean

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,096
Show you in the compiler

14
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,144
What what is actually doing

15
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,776
And then we take it from there let's see

16
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:44,800
We have

17
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:46,592
a few views here

18
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:50,176
I've imported Sermon distributor

19
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,760
Which is the most common demo component

20
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:54,784
that I have used

21
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
And

22
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,208
It has a few custom Fields so I could

23
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,768
I could actually change this where's it

24
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
This one

25
00:01:06,816 --> 00:01:08,096
Is changed to custom

26
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,680
And we see that we've got a few custom Fields here

27
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:14,496
The idea was that you would

28
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,568
Use the demo components and then

29
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,104
Figure out

30
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,664
How their custom Fields work

31
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
And it's doing so

32
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
know help us and fields work but ok

33
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,112
I'm gonna

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,904
Well first of all

35
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,720
Custom fields is a way

36
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,744
To connect

37
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
a table

38
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:42,912
From another view of course

39
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,568
Into another view so it's it's a way to build relationships then you can

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,128
Have more than one custom field

41
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:53,408
In a table

42
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
And

43
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,760
You can do that to build relationships

44
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,064
You could even

45
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:00,832
Take

46
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,648
Different tables

47
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
And

48
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,696
Create

49
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:09,792
A different combined list of values

50
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
You can't really do anything with

51
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,960
Custom Fields it is

52
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:19,776
Maybe one of the most powerful

53
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
Field types in JCB

54
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,480
Now if we If we open let's say editor let me just do that

55
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
I wanna show you that

56
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:35,648
Custom fields are basically a Joomla implemented

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,672
Concept

58
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
Implementation or how can I say that

59
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:43,840
So you have in models you have well let's open the

60
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,144
Correct folder here

61
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,448
not this one

62
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,824
This one we wanna go to sermon distributor

63
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:58,688
You have in your models folder you have a folder called fields

64
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,808
Now and Joomla 4 this is changing the folder structure but

65
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,136
in for now you'll you'll know it's it's here

66
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:13,792
and so here is our custom fields is basically a field that you create

67
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,376
By creating a file in this folder and then

68
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:19,424
Using the field name

69
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
In your XML so if you look at your form

70
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
And let's say we use

71
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
Sermon

72
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,200
You will see that in the XML

73
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,552
At the top we have add file a field path

74
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
And you see that it edits in the model

75
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,624
So

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:41,440
Because of how we do it it

77
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:43,744
Expects it to be here

78
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,560
So even yeah anyway

79
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,352
So

80
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,168
That's why it knows to go look for the field here

81
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,472
Now if you scroll down

82
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,520
You'll see that we have a normal

83
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:57,824
And wherever it says Joomla

84
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,128
It means it's a normal field

85
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
At the moment it says custom

86
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:08,832
It means that this is not a normal field this field was made custom for this component

87
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,624
Now this is just a

88
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:14,464
Note it's like the comment doesn't do anything

89
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,000
It's just is for you

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,839
So this so you can come here

91
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
In the fields area

92
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:24,447
And there's preachers this is the

93
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:27,519
File that makes this work

94
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
So

95
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,847
That's basically what JCB builds

96
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:34,943
He puts this in place and then builds this file and that's it

97
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
And so

98
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
In these files

99
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
Depending on what type of file we are extending so now we are extending here the list

100
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
Option now to know what is all the available extending options we go to

101
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,119
Joomla component builders File

102
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
We go to the compiler

103
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,239
We go to Joomla 3

104
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,799
we scroll down we'll see there is

105
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:02,335
the checkboxes

106
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Option

107
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,687
There is the field list the field radio

108
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
And the field user but the field user we actually made a whole custom field to just target the field user

109
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
But the checkboxes and the radio if you if you go back to JCB

110
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,559
And create new

111
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,631
And you select

112
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
Custom

113
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
you'd see

114
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,031
That it

115
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,847
At some point where is it

116
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Let's see

117
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,991
It asked here what do you extend

118
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,647
And you have these three options you can extend that a list as a radio button or a check

119
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Checkboxes

120
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,975
That is what this

121
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,023
Extend is for

122
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:54,303
So

123
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,887
That's currently the only 3 that is

124
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:05,055
Ready to go in JCB there there are of course others

125
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:09,919
But then we'll have to expand JCB it doesn't reach those yet

126
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
Ok so getting back to this

127
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:20,415
If you are using a form list which is the most common one because you wanted have a list of things in

128
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Another table

129
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:22,975
Then

130
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,279
You're gonna have to populate

131
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:28,095
The get options function

132
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:30,911
Now the get options function

133
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Or method

134
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Is

135
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
Requiring this chunk of code

136
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Now

137
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:44,223
Instead of making it that you need to write out this whole thing

138
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,831
In JCB you are just adding this part

139
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,367
For the

140
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
List

141
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,415
For the radio

142
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:54,463
It's also just

143
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,487
The

144
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,767
Get options

145
00:06:57,279 --> 00:07:01,631
For the checkboxes again also just get options

146
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,399
So

147
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,031
It is basically the only code we need to have it's only with the user one

148
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Which

149
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
We have a get groups

150
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
And exclude

151
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,151
And

152
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
If you create in JCB

153
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
Excuse me if you

154
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:21,855
Here select custom user

155
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,487
You'd see that that is exactly what you get you get exclude area

156
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:32,351
and you get get group area and these two chunks of code

157
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,911
Is What is going to be placed

158
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,983
In in this area here

159
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
That's basically what is gonna happen

160
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,359
So you could at any time

161
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:49,759
Coming here fiddle around with this I mean it in the PHP in when the file is created

162
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:51,295
Like like over

163
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,319
over here

164
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
I've got this preacher open right

165
00:07:54,623 --> 00:08:00,767
You can come in here and fill with us and then take your changes just back to the view to JCB

166
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
And just place it in here

167
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,631
not well not in this one this is the user

168
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,911
But in a custom

169
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,191
Ok so

170
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:14,591
Basically that means that this did the type is movable

171
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,711
Because it's new but it must be something that doesn't already exist in Joomla

172
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:25,343
And if you don't know what all the field types are that exist in Joomla then

173
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,671
A good place to start is to go to field types

174
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,487
And check out all these

175
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,583
And if that still isn't clear you can go to this place

176
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,399
This URL here

177
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:43,263
This has a list of all Joomlas field types so you could

178
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,055
You could open that

179
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,383
Scroll down

180
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:54,271
And here is a list of all the field type names that you can't use again

181
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,295
You can't

182
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,087
Well it will be conflicting

183
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,647
Because it will break that name in that form

184
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:00,927
So

185
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,999
Best use names that are not used by Joomla

186
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,559
Ok so that is that

187
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:10,911
Going back to creating a custom field

188
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,775
We could start with sermon preacher which is the one we looking at

189
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
So

190
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:23,455
Again the name up here is just for the interface for you it's just that you can see what is the field

191
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,991
You can call this anything

192
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,063
It only fall back onto this name

193
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:29,343
If

194
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
If there isn't a

195
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,207
A label

196
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Set here

197
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,071
Then it will fall back onto this name

198
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:42,143
But the ideal is just set the label you know

199
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
Then the name here

200
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,543
This name again is actually the code right

201
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,871
That we know this is the type this is what is going to be

202
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:53,151
To be new unique

203
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
the rest is sort of the same as everything else multiple

204
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,367
the default value because it's dynamic

205
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,439
It's not really practical

206
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,303
But it's really gonna be whatever you choose to be the ID of this

207
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,327
Memory right

208
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,727
Required read only this is all &&&&&ok extend here you make your choice what kind of

209
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
Field do you want to create

210
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:25,151
Then button the button feature is one of the

211
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,967
Features that are actually quite exciting

212
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:30,271
Let me show you some of that

213
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:35,903
So I was seeing a strange behaviour here I was seeing that the button says true

214
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
And then when I go to the code

215
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:40,767
I don't see the button code in here

216
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:46,143
And I was wondering ok what's going on here and then I remembered

217
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
 when JCB detects that

218
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
There is

219
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Two

220
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,335
Custom

221
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,895
Fields with the same type

222
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
It only uses one

223
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,271
For this area

224
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,319
And for the button

225
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,903
Because one of them

226
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,463
Is going to be there

227
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,511
Dominant one

228
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
You can decide which one it is so you want to share the field type among multiple 

229
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Custom

230
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Fields

231
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:24,031
so you want to reuse that field type you can

232
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:26,591
But you want to make sure that

233
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,407
One of them is the one which you know

234
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,223
Is going to be the leader if you will

235
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,295
The one who decides how things happen

236
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:42,207
So that if you change that one the field type updates where is if you change the wrong one it doesn't do anything

237
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,815
So just one of those will be the

238
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,191
The dominant one so you could do that by making it the prime

239
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:57,567
prime  PHP and make that one so here is a little explanation of that

240
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:01,151
So you wanna be sure this field

241
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
Called preachers

242
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:08,831
Should be the dominant and you wanna say I want the buttons to be true

243
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,903
And now you save and compile

244
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,719
You you will get what you expect

245
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:19,071
And so that's another feature of custom

246
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,935
 fields that 

247
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:29,055
 people are not aware of this feature but it's it makes it very useful

248
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,871
So if we now go back to the code

249
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:36,479
We see now a new set of a script here called get input

250
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,879
And that's really how the button gets added so basically asks

251
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
Get the attribute button

252
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
it checks if button is true

253
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
If button is true

254
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:55,679
Then it already got the parent HTML which is what

255
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:58,751
The button the whole field is in this HTML

256
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
Then we do some

257
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,199
Because if you have a button and someone Clicks on it you might want them to

258
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:13,087
Be Redirected back to this page where the field is once they done on the other page

259
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:17,951
So this is what it does here it checks if there is a

260
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:18,975
Referral

261
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:23,327
And also we've added the return value

262
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,399
As well so if there is a return value

263
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:29,471
We are going to detect it

264
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,263
oh no, wait, sorry

265
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,103
We are building a return value as well that's right

266
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,663
Ok so we come down here

267
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:42,527
And we're starting to build the button so there is the the button being built

268
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:46,111
And that is to create

269
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
And then there's also one now

270
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,303
You see that if the button name

271
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,583
Preacher

272
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,143
Or preachers

273
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,191
Is

274
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:05,055
Is the same as the area to which you are

275
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,967
The preacher..... OK because this this inputs name is preacher right

276
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,247
If we

277
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,807
go back here

278
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
This is called preachers right and down here

279
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:24,511
We have a view called preacher and preachers

280
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:27,839
So that is the Single View

281
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,607
Right

282
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:32,191
Single View name of the place the field is added

283
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:40,127
And this is the listview so we are grabbing the field data from the preacher

284
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:44,479
View and it's list name is preachers so

285
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,831
It's the table where the data is being captured from

286
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:52,159
Not the table where you gonna show the field but

287
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,743
The table where you are taking the information from

288
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:02,143
Now you taking it from multiple tables then he must choose a dominant table 

289
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,191
The one that you want to be

290
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,983
Always available

291
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,591
So that's what this is as well as this as you can see

292
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:15,967
It is obviously usually the case that this and this values the same

293
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
But I decided to just give us

294
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:23,135
The option to change the table name anyway

295
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Ok so we

296
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:26,207
Will get to these again

297
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:28,255
Just wanted you to see you

298
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
Sorry show you that if those two

299
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
Actually line-up

300
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,215
The button name lines up with those two

301
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:38,751
Then

302
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:44,895
it checks whether this is current user has authority to actually edit buttons

303
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:51,551
We come down here

304
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,135
And we create and edit button

305
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
So

306
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,487
And we also write JavaScript

307
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:01,023
to

308
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,303
Give that

309
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
Button behaviour when you click

310
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:07,935
Change the field it checks ok

311
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:10,239
Is that value and then it

312
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:16,639
Updates that you can check out this JavaScript here.

313
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:22,271
This one up here is used to generate the create button and it also validates

314
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
Whether

315
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,599
This user

316
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,135
Has create

317
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Options

318
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
And is there is a user in the admin area currently this feature is

319
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:40,447
Is not available to the site area and

320
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:46,847
It's because of many conventions in the site area is so custom it'll probably

321
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Break this button so

322
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:55,295
We'll have to work at this but this is where we are at we were able to Target the admin area with this kind of button

323
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,623
And then if we have a button

324
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:03,231
We actually add the button declaration

325
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,279
To the document

326
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
And then we add the buttons

327
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:09,887
To the field with this

328
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,215
Input append this class here

329
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
Is a Joomla

330
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
Class

331
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
Which means we falling back on their implementation on how to add a little tweak to the button sorry to the field

332
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:30,111
So we just add this and that is how the button gets added and how it works

333
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:34,207
You mean you can come through this I mean this is quite simple

334
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,999
It's very easy code here

335
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:41,375
This this implementation here is just to make sure that the button name follows the convention

336
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:44,447
And naming convention

337
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
And

338
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:52,895
Yeah so that's that's the HTML and JavaScript that sets up the button and

339
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
The reason why you would sometimes see the edit button there and sometimes not is about this relationship here

340
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,599
The 

341
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Button name

342
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Must match one of these

343
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
So if it doesn't

344
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,023
It won't add it

345
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,583
It's sort of

346
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,191
It's necessary for that to be like that because of

347
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,983
You wanna have a

348
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,311
Button that already knows where we going right

349
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,431
And how can I know those values at the moment the only values we have here

350
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:30,015
Are these values it's come up here

351
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
These values

352
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,391
We don't have

353
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:38,719
Other values

354
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,279
This is the values we have the view ID

355
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:45,887
So That's what we have to work with and so if there's no relationship

356
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:52,287
Then how can we How can we set the edit button the relationship must be set so this is the way we

357
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:58,687
Set a relationship that's quite simple right you just make sure that the name of the

358
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,735
The button this one won't work

359
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
So although we said the button here to be true

360
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:11,487
It will check the name and see how this doesn't match and it won't add a button and that's good because we don't want that

361
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:15,327
Actually a button here we want a button to show up in this one

362
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,911
And so when it loads this button

363
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:24,543
It will check the name it'll say ah yeah this one matches and it will add a button

364
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,567
So

365
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,687
That's the right behaviour That's what we want so if we compile it now

366
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,783
&&&&&&&&&&&@@@

367
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,319
We can just come here

368
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:38,367
And go to

369
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,415

00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,559
We'll see it now has an edit option

372
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:49,119
If we select none and has a great option

373
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,935
Select this it has a edit option

374
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:56,031
That is sort of how that relationship comes together

375
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,383
So were are we

376
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,687
go back

377
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
To the field

378
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,319
Ok

379
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
So

380
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,647
Oh this is a wrong one

381
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
So now we have the buttons set

382
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,351
That's really the whole discussion

383
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:24,959
And you could if you don't want the button set

384
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
But you want the button on the page

385
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
Set this to false

386
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,455
Or just leave it out yeah it will take the button away completely

387
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:40,063
Now this table value is a mandatory value

388
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:46,719
Because it gives us a dynamic value which we can use in

389
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,535
In many places including here

390
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:55,935
You see a list button gets added to a page as well if we

391
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:02,335
If we look back here at this implementation we see that here is a list

392
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Again

393
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,895
But this isn't even in the view

394
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,455
This is in the list View

395
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
So you can

396
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
Have a filter

397
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:15,903
Dynamically in place for this again in the batch as well if you if you select batch

398
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
There is also one available to select so all of these fields

399
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,424
Are still using the information that we give here

400
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:33,312
So if you don't have this information then some of these Fields functions will just

401
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,336
Disappear

402
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:35,104
It will

403
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
Most probably not break

404
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
But it will not be there so if you to see the fields filtering option is not working then it's because of

405
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,112
 these settings that are not right

406
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:51,744
Now to give you a perspective on how it adds that

407
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
This little

408
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:55,840
Drop down here how does it do that

409
00:21:56,352 --> 00:22:00,448
Well in the code again if we go to that View

410
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Which is the

411
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
plural preachers

412
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,360
And we scroll down

413
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
We have a

414
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Function

415
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Called

416
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,368
here it is

417
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,904
Filter

418
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Ok so we go up

419
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,256
And we see

420
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
There's a preachers one

421
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,984
Import data

422
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,032
What is the buttons

423
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
filters

424
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
Looking at the wrong one

425
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
I should be looking at

426
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:34,912
Sermons

427
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:43,104
So here we have a load field type

428
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,128
Preachers

429
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,480
And it basically gets options

430
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,016
see

431
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,832
So this is really targeting

432
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
This

433
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:59,232
Options area this get options it's calling that function

434
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
And

435
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:05,120
Then if we have values it actually adds them into the filter

436
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:11,520
And it checks are we doing badge and if this can create can edit validates

437
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,592
Yes then it adds it to the batch as well

438
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
So

439
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:21,760
We are falling back onto the field type get options even in your filter

440
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,576
And so

441
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:31,232
That's why we have the filters easily integrated and it's the value is still use

442
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Using

443
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,536
The

444
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,352
Values that you placed in the field

445
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,632
So

446
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:41,472
That's how we get this value that's how we get that value

447
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,080
Yeah that's basically it

448
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,616
Ok next

449
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:54,528
We have the components name now the reason why these can be dynamic

450
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
Is because

451
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,624
The table as well as the component name

452
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,392
It

453
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:05,792
 is possible for you to reuse fields in different admin views and different components

454
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:09,888
 and then that can be dynamically update it

455
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
And it should just work when you want to have a relationship from one

456
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,616
Table into another component altogether

457
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
Then you have to hard code

458
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,688
Component a

459
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,784
So let's say you have component a where you have a view

460
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
adminView where this field is used

461
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
And you want to take the data

462
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
From

463
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,256
That View

464
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,560
Into another

465
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:41,632
Component altogether

466
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
Then you have to add component a's

467
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,848
Static name in here and not the placeholder ok that's enough of that there has been discussions on 

468
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,432
forums about this so you could search up and find answers I suppose

469
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,528
Then we have a field value and a key field

470
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
Value field and key field

471
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,952
I should have maybe given this different names I suppose because

472
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,792
Basically the key field is the ID field

473
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:16,704
Down here that place holder is the same as here and I'm actually saying it over there

474
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
The field value

475
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
Is the text value

476
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Over there

477
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,152
Now

478
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:27,200
The code text

479
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
Is basically

480
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,856
This text value again

481
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,768
But it didn't gets placed over here so this and that value is basically the same value this is

482
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,328
just the one that gets taken to the code

483
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,912
Well it's what becomes available in the item

484
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
So

485
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,960
You could

486
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:54,848
Change this to whatever you like this place holders are there only to make your life easier

487
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,688
If it doesn't help then just replace them with static values

488
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:06,368
But the advantage of them being like this is you can come up here and decide I no longer want to store the ID

489
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:11,744
Because this is the value that get stored right it is the value that is over on this side

490
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,864
J HTML method setting up an option

491
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:24,032
Takes the second value which is this one has the value that get stored in the database and the third the

492
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,360
Value as the value that gets shown in the drop down list

493
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:30,688
So these are the two values that you're working with

494
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,504
Now you can add here any

495
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
PHP you like

496
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:41,952
I mean you could you could grab from any other table you could do a very complicated query here and

497
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:44,000
Generate a whole different list

498
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,864
And just make sure that the ideas are not going to Clash

499
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
And if you expect

500
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,984
ID clashing then if you need to add

501
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,336
Maybe ID underscore something for one

502
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:04,736
Place's information ID underscore something else for another place's information you could do that because

503
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,296
Because this this selection concept

504
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:11,136
We'll keep on using this pattern all across JCB

505
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
This is where you set

506
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:13,952
The

507
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,232
Relationship

508
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:21,632
Inheritance structure everything this is just this area and it affects everything across JCB

509
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:24,448
Wherever this field is going to be used

510
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,520
This is going to be available

511
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,592
So it always

512
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:34,432
It means that you have a lot of Freedom in this little

513
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,784
Block because that's what's gonna be at the end of day end up being placed here

514
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
And

515
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,856
You can

516
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:47,744
Get from other tables you can do other and you know interesting relationships here

517
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
But

518
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,560
That is 

519
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,888
Important that at least the main table

520
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,704
Is the one that you mentioned here

521
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:00,288
And the main component is the one you mentioned here

522
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
And it

523
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
That

524
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,384
Tables

525
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,016
View and list views names are used here and then the value

526
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,088
I mean in this table this one here

527
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:18,976
You are grabbing two values you're grabbing a value to show to the user

528
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632
And value to save in the database that's the key value the key field that is the value

529
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:29,472
Get stored in the database if you're using

530
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:31,520
This implementation

531
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,872
If you're not then this doesn't really

532
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:41,248
Yeah you can just leave it out if you if you're not gonna use this

533
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:48,416
You can hardcode whatever values you want down here it'll still work infact I would

534
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:51,232
Encourage you to test it

535
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
You know

536
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,608
I have built Fields custom Fields which I left out

537
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
All of this information

538
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,472
And only did everything in here

539
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
And

540
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,544
It still worked

541
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:11,200
Because I was actually having such Dynamic value retrieval based on so many other concepts

542
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:17,600
Of the current view I even grab the ID from the from the input to determine the

543
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:19,904
Get relationship so

544
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:22,464
They are very nice

545
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
Options let me show you one of those fields

546
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:32,192
Here is the field it's called member it's an external I'm using it in a

547
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
external component

548
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,032
The field type is member

549
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,896
Ok so I hard coded the table and the component names

550
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:45,248
But down here in the option the get option

551
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,344
You see I have a whole different set of PHP script

552
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Which

553
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,928
Is using

554
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:58,816
Custom help methods to check access

555
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,608
It's also up here

556
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:02,656
We were basically where is it

557
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:09,056
Yeah I'm getting the input and I'm checking is there referral values to a field ID value and if

558
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
 there is it I'm using this

559
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,152
This values

560
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:18,272
Down into the searching and getting here it says

561
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,576
Load the main member only

562
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
You know there's all kinds of

563
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:26,464
Tricks I'm doing and it's all happening in the PHP and I know

564
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,256
That this PHP

565
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Is getting dumped

566
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,584
Into this area here

567
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:38,752
So the get options is what is being used across JCB for the field

568
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:45,152
And so I'm able to do anything that you can with PHP in here

569
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:49,504
To determine what the options must be for the custom field

570
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,856
Always remembering that there needs to be in 

571
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,512
This area here the needs to be a value which I want to be placed in the database and a

572
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,096
Value I want my user to see these values can

573
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
Theoretically be exactly the same

574
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Like that

575
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
I didn't have to be

576
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,312
really

577
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,616
doesn't matter

578
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:22,016
You decide the only reality is if that's the value you place in the database that's the type of value

579
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,296
You need to set up

580
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:25,856
So if this is going to be a string

581
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
This value here

582
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,976
Then you need to come back

583
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,256
And you need to

584
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:33,024
Check

585
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,864
That your database is not an integer

586
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,240
Because if you saving a string you want at least have a Varchar

587
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,288
about 250

588
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,824
Now that'll work

589
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:49,664
But if you change the

590
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,944
Multiple

591
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,968
That means

592
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:56,320
Can a user a select more than one value if you change that true

593
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,208
Again you need to change your database to at least text

594
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
to

595
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:09,632
Be able to store or a very big Varchar which is also possible

596
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,936
To store these values

597
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:17,568
if they are gonna be strings then I usually just use text I just like it

598
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
Easy enough

599
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:25,248
And if it's going to be lots of options you can go

600
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
bulk ,there is even

601
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,184
 way more than I think you would ever need but ok so

602
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:37,024
The reality is we can

603
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,424
determine what these values are so here I'm making sure that the member value is an ID

604
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:47,264
But I'm using a helper method

605
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
To take this ID

606
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
And get the members name

607
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:57,760
Why because the member's name is difficult to know because it could be different values based on the

608
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:04,160
Different member types some members there having their name in the user table some members they have in there

609
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
 names in the members table

610
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:10,048
So that's different places the members name can actually live

611
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:14,144
So with this little function I wrote in the helper class

612
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:17,984
I can determine the members name by simply the ID

613
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,664
Or I could add the user and the name and it makes it quicker to for the function so this function has

614
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:32,064
Little bit of a speed up if I have these values available but like over here I don't so I only pass the ID and

615
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,600
It still works

616
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,904
And so

617
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:43,584
This is the  maneuverability of a selection

618
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:50,240
You can adapt this to whatever you want the only reality is that the moment you set

619
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,544
Your I would call it convention

620
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
Of this field type

621
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,456
Then you need to honour that Convention across your component

622
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,784
If you decide that you're saving a string in that field

623
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,856
Then you need to everywhere now you dealing with the string

624
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:11,744
If you're saying you're saving a multiple select then you might wanna

625
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,024
Do

626
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:17,376
You know the default storing method usually works

627
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,656
Out of the box

628
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,240
If it doesn't you can come and try Json

629
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:28,640
Especially when you have multiple values but usually it does it out of the box and I can show you why

630
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,456
If we go to the compiler

631
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:35,040
We go to the fields

632
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:40,672
Class in the compiler it has a function called set Builder

633
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
Now the set builder function is really a little oversized at the moment it started out

634
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,096
Small believe me

635
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
And I could

636
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:55,776
See the option of decoupling some of this out into its own separate methods but

637
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:59,616
It works very well and it's easy to understand so

638
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:02,688
If I just collapse this here we can see more

639
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:08,832
So now we come down here we ask what is the data type

640
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,624
Is it set

641
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,184
And if it's set we determine

642
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,000
Through various methods ok

643
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:22,656
This is what we have and we go ahead and we set database keys and all kinds of database relationship

644
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:28,032
 information query builder gets updated with a lot of information and stuff

645
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:31,360
So the database information gets used up here

646
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,968
If we have

647
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:39,296
....... it is a different concept

648
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
if we scroll down

649
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,184
We wanna look at the storage switches

650
00:36:45,696 --> 00:36:47,488
So coming down here

651
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:58,240
Where we get to setup checkbox and other joint items for this view

652
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,288
We are basically

653
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,824
Going to check

654
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,872
What type of field is this

655
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,944
If it's a subform if it's check boxes

656
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:13,600
Or if the store method is not zero which is default

657
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,904
If we have a database switch

658
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,952
And

659
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
That it's not a tag the type name

660
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:25,376
Ok now we coming here if it's any of these fields

661
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:28,704
It will check if you set your own storage

662
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
Switch

663
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,568
Obviously if none is set it will fall back onto the Json

664
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:36,128
It needs to be Json

665
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,664
If it one of those fields

666
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,064
So it automatically builds it so that means the default will be Json then if you select Json it

667
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
It will still be Json

668
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:52,000
So that's just how this catch works if you don't know it should be we will

669
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,816
In the compiler sort of help you

670
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Get to the same place

671
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
Now

672
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,496
That also means that sometimes

673
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:09,408
You might have a multiple select option in a list field which is not a subform not

674
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,432
check Boxes

675
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
But it's multiple

676
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,392
The multiple gets triggered the multiple switch so it will still come in here

677
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,208
So what even if you set

678
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:23,744
it to be Json

679
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,816
Where in the compiler have the multiple

680
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,656
Switch to check is this field having multiple selection

681
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:34,240
Yes well then we need to save save it as a json

682
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:41,152
That is what this does so takes care of the fact that it's Json but

683
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:50,880
It mustn't be a tag and it must have a database switch and database which just means the data

684
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:57,280
Must be going to be stored into the database if there's no storing of the data in the

685
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:02,400
Database we obviously don't need any of this. So the multiple switch

686
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,448
If we search it up

687
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,264
We'll see that it actually gets passed

688
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:11,104
To the builder right there one of the it's

689
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,408
parameters

690
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:15,712
We go and search

691
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:22,112
Where the Builder all is used will see that the multiple switch is also in a variable

692
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:26,208
So we can go up and you can search

693
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,792
You can search for this where does multiple get set

694
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,864
Ok so we started of

695
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
This this method

696
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:39,264
Didn't start with multiple so that scroll down let's see

697
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
Where is multiple come from

698
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,152
There's multiple

699
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:48,224
And it's set to False to start with

700
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:48,992
Ok

701
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,808
So we're in the beginning of set the dynamic field

702
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,464
We check multiple is false then we get set field attributes and multiple gets passed to it

703
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,584
Let's check field attributes we go let's go to the actual function

704
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:09,984
We see here comes multiple but it's passed with a reference that means he whatever we do to this value

705
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
In this method

706
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,312
We'll go back to where it started

707
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
So over here

708
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,408
We doing a check

709
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:21,760
At some point Let's see we got Properties

710
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:25,344
Validate

711
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,952
Let's search that the variable multiple

712
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,232
That's go ha

713
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:37,376
Here we found the property name which is multiple

714
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
We retrieve the value

715
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,240
From the XML

716
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:48,896
Check that the value gets added here and we check is that value true and if it's true we

717
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,176
trip the switch

718
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:56,064
To multiple so that literally gets down the through what you put into the JCB

719
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,344
Interface

720
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
This little

721
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:00,672
Field

722
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,208
Where is it

723
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,304
If you

724
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,656
Set this to True it will trip that behaviour

725
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,728
So that's how that works

726
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,592
So the multiple switch is a powerful switch and it

727
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,664
Really helps you even if you miss

728
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,456
The the storage

729
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,784
Obviously it doesn't update the database

730
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,368
Selection but if you miss the storage thing

731
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,416
The default will work

732
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,440
Ok

733
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:39,840
But if you did that it will still work even if you select one of the encryption options it will

734
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
Still work

735
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,216
Because it actually is a little bit intelligent

736
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,800
Ok so if we go back here

737
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:51,616
And we go back to the

738
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Set Builder

739
00:41:54,175 --> 00:42:00,319
The set builder function is one of those places where you could figure out a whole lot of things

740
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,879
About how they JCB compiles

741
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,159
Custom fields

742
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,279
So this is a good place to start you know your search

743
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:13,887
The other one that we already looked at is the set attribute

744
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
This one here

745
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:22,847
The set attributes is where we actually work with the original values that we get from the database the properties

746
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:26,431
As well as the actual field

747
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:27,967
So

748
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,087
We use the field value to determine many things

749
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:39,743
And we parse every value, the reason why we remapped this is to make sure we can 

750
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,559
Sort of fix things if you made a mistake

751
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:46,399
So there is some some things here to try and catch

752
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,447
Any

753
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,079
Human error on the side of JCB that also means you could be doing something wrong

754
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
and things still work

755
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,639
That happens

756
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:04,319
And then someday maybe someone decides no they don't want to catch that fix anymore

757
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,623
You know which I'm trying to

758
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,183
You know prevent I wanna keep the

759
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,463
The fixing place

760
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,023
And then suddenly your

761
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Project

762
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,815
Doesn't work

763
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,119
I'm trying to avoid that

764
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:20,191
But it's good to know how it must be done

765
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,215
Right

766
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
So you just do it that way

767
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,287
To start with

768
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Ok

769
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,615
So

770
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,407
That is

771
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,735
Basically a little bit of that, let's go back to the field

772
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,527
Suggest in conclusion

773
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,367
You could add any kind of code here

774
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:41,183
Basically it is what gets

775
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:45,023
The list and it's with this string here

776
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:51,167
That you are adding options to the list so basically in this little chunk here

777
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:58,079
Basically you check do I have the items if yes you can decide if you want to put a placeholder you 

778
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
See there select a Preacher if we go to sermon

779
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
And

780
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,199
We

781
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:07,807
We see that it's first option is select a Preacher

782
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:13,951
And it is basically this little snippet here that does that

783
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
So you could

784
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
You could do that now

785
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
The

786
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,887
When you do multiple select

787
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:23,423
Then this

788
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
Doesn't work well

789
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
just take it from me

790
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,031
If you up here

791
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,055
Chose

792
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:31,103
To allow multiple

793
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:31,871
Where is it

794
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
here

795
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,407
True

796
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Then

797
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:37,247
I would suggest you take this option now

798
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:41,343
Because it will be look like an option to select it won't

799
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,647
Behave the same as now

800
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:48,767
Where you actually click away and it's gone it will be an option and

801
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,351
The option is a blank there's like a no string

802
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
That is how

803
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,167
We detect

804
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,447
That it's empty

805
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,751
It's this no string value here

806
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
Ok so

807
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:07,711
That is what that is up there and then you start looping this t forward slash is basically

808
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,295
A tab so you could put an actual tab in there

809
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,879
The way I do that is I would go to

810
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,207
you copy a tag from here copy go back

811
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,767
And paste it in

812
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,047
And

813
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,327
You could do this

814
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,143
In fact

815
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,215
Most of the time this is the better way

816
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
to

817
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,775
To make the code look

818
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
Beautiful

819
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,335
And

820
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:38,175
Correctly spaced This is This is often what I do

821
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:40,479
Is I move all the code

822
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,783
Just one little knots

823
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,087
In fact I think I needs to be two

824
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
So I move it all

825
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,231
Like this and I know it sounds

826
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,255
Crazy

827
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,327
But that is what I do

828
00:45:56,863 --> 00:46:02,239
So now the code will look very nice and good in the display

829
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
If I save it

830
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,287
Let's

831
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,847
Let's make a little comment here

832
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Hi there

833
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,431
and then

834
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:14,271
This is set to be the prime so save and close

835
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,831
And now we can

836
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,879
Go and compile this

837
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,047
Install

838
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:31,423
And in our preacher table we have that little hi there

839
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,799
And unfortunately the first value should not have a space

840
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,919
Yeah the spacing of

841
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:47,039
Of field types is still well many areas actually in JCB

842
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:53,183
It's like where we're at a place where I don't know how we will be able to fix this

843
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:59,583
So that it always behaves sort of better like that is now with you I need to do to get that space in just right

844
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,911
And I I know that feels a little

845
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
Wrong place

846
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:05,983
That feels a little

847
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
Uncomfortable

848
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,103
But it's really

849
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,431
It's difficult to catch it correctly for every

850
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:15,455
Implementation

851
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
So

852
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
Currently

853
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
That's the work around

854
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,695
so if we compile it

855
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
and we go back

856
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,583
We check it's Now it's correct

857
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,887
And there's our little note

858
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,447
So our spacing is working out

859
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,775
If you didn't add the space

860
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
it will

861
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,847
Sometimes work out something like that

862
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:45,151
That's how it look

863
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Ok

864
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:50,527
Which still will work it just doesn't look nice

865
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:57,695
So on this view we have this as a custom field this is a custom field

866
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,023
This is category field the tag field

867
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
And this is a custom field

868
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:08,191
So we have

869
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:10,239
Many different

870
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,287
Custom fields

871
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:15,359
Which is quite nice

872
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,711
List folder this is a custom field a multiple select

873
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:21,247
Custom field

874
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,783
External

875
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,599
This is a custom field

876
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,159
This is a custom field

877
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
So

878
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
There are many custom fields on this page

879
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,327
And you can actually

880
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,631
In JCB when you've imported

881
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,191
sermon distributor

882
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,495
If you don't know how to do that

883
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:44,287
There are tutorials

884
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:50,175
Maybe the best quickest path to showing you that it's just JCB import

885
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:51,967
Then VDM packages

886
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,991
How to get

887
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,551
Free keys from VBM

888
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:58,623
Because sermon distributor

889
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,927
Is one of the three packages

890
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:04,255
There are many free packages not all of them are

891
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:06,303
Free like these are not free

892
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,351
But

893
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:14,239
They are even component builder is one of the free packages that you can get a key for

894
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,543
So you could click here go get a key

895
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:19,103
I tell you the the

896
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,919
The way that we have

897
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,711
Build components

898
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:24,991
In JCB

899
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,295
And all the fields that we've used

900
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,855
I mean you can come here you can go to

901
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Preacher

902
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:35,231
And all those custom Fields that I just clicked

903
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
They are here

904
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,607
Wait this is not the right one sermon

905
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,399
This the one had so many

906
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,447
So it's this one

907
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:50,079
To come to Fields and here they are that's custom

908
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,383
That one is custom

909
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:55,199
This one

910
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,223
This one

911
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,783
You could click this local file list

912
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,599
Wanna see how to list and local file list

913
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,391
With a custom field

914
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:06,719
Well this is how I did it I don't even have look here

915
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:08,255
There isn't even

916
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Any

917
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Table here

918
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:14,399
There's even the button is false

919
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:16,959
Extend list yes

920
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:21,567
I doesn't have a table doesn't have a component none of that I just dumped it

921
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,847
And

922
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
I you see the first one is

923
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
Back there

924
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,343
Now I get parameters I first get the folder path from the global so if you want to see for

925
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,255
Example oh how did he set this how to get this setting while let's go out of this would come back here again

926
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,095
And out of this

927
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,399
Then let's go to the component

928
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,775
And you'll see that there is a component config area we open that

929
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:56,383
Going of the path a bit but just bear with me

930
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,431
And one of those

931
00:50:58,943 --> 00:51:00,223
Fields

932
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,319
Let's see set up here no

933
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,647
it's sermon s

934
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,951
there's obviously many in this one

935
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:13,791
Sermon

936
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:20,447
Let's see Sermon menu sermon panel box

937
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,263
Sermon media

938
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,895
Sermon

939
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,967
Ok it's not down here

940
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
execution time

941
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,527
Download

942
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:37,599
So

943
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,695
It was up here all along

944
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,743
Local folder path

945
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,815
So it's a It's a text area

946
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:53,215
Which is in sermon tab so if we go here and we click options

947
00:51:55,519 --> 00:52:01,663
There is a sermon tab and there it is local folder path so you can set the local folder path for this

948
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,991
Where the local files are going to be placed

949
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,271
And

950
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,575
It is because of this file here

951
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
This field

952
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:14,463
Now if you wanna check the fields check the spelling local folder path close it out

953
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:17,023
And go to fields

954
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:18,303
And type in

955
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,631
Local

956
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Local

957
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:34,943
ok

958
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Oops

959
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,879
So there it is this a text one we select that

960
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,439
Are you can see how I built that

961
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:46,975
Simple field type

962
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:47,999
For the hint

963
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,791
Nothing fancy

964
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,631
Now I'm going back to our field

965
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,423
If we

966
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,727
Go back to the field we were looking at

967
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:00,287
We go back to admin View

968
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:05,151
We don't need to go into the sermons

969
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:10,015
But ok that that is a easier way right so we go in here

970
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,087
Now we go get into local file

971
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,623
Open that

972
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,975
So basically in our component

973
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:25,631
We checking this components value for local folder and if it hasn't got one we fall back unto images

974
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,911
The image path

975
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
And that's where we start

976
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
Now

977
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
We do a first option

978
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:38,687
Which is please add files and we take the local folder path result

979
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
And we pass it into here

980
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,271
into options

981
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,063
Now

982
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:49,439
Then we load the file import Ops classes

983
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:53,023
And we check does the folder exist

984
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,583
If it doesn't we create the folder

985
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,911
Now check if there is files in the folder

986
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,239
So we do get files This is the

987
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,287
Function in Jfolder

988
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
And

989
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
If it's true

990
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,895
We actually take the files and we

991
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,479
Reset the get options because remember up here we

992
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
told it to add files but now here with this we reset basically the

993
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Options variable

994
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,999
And now we start loading the files and then we give it back

995
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:27,839
And so we used both value here see file and file

996
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:32,447
Which is actually very easy way to

997
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:36,543
To do a local folder setup

998
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,407
And make people select now again we just looking at demo

999
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
Component

1000
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,479
we just looking at it

1001
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:49,343
external source manual file is also custom how am I doing this

1002
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,719
Well it's quite complicated thing so it is a

1003
00:54:55,231 --> 00:55:00,351
Basically I'm using a helper class get external source link

1004
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,447
And I don't again look at that there is no table

1005
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,751
There's no no external component

1006
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
There's nothing

1007
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,055
Just

1008
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:16,991
Just these values go look at it if that's all it is there and it's working that should tell you that you could do the same

1009
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:22,879
And get it to go because this is the actual issue this result

1010
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:24,927
That's what we need to have correct

1011
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,839
So having looked at this or get external links source while that's an helper

1012
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,655
Class how is that close that out

1013
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,751
Helper classes are stored in the component area

1014
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,055
So you go to Joomla components

1015
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
Go into the component

1016
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,175
And you go to libs helpers

1017
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,479
And here you can scroll down

1018
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:51,551
And get download links

1019
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,135
is a big method

1020
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,671
get

1021
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,695
We should have

1022
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,719
Copy that

1023
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,375
So here is a function get external source length and has a few arguments

1024
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:11,263
And it does a few other get externals listing

1025
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:14,079
And does a few trip switches here

1026
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,615
And

1027
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,431
That's how I eventually return

1028
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,735
Something to that function

1029
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
And

1030
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,783
We get that list

1031
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,319
Ok so

1032
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:27,903
That's how you should take demo components and

1033
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:34,303
Sort of decipher it's implementation structures and don't think it's more complicated than

1034
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,863
That it isn't it's really simple

1035
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:40,447
JCB is very 

1036
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Resilient

1037
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
It can

1038
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,055
Adapt itself to

1039
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,591
Specific implementations

1040
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,639
So the custom field

1041
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,455
Is my opinion one of the fields I

1042
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:53,247
Have enjoyed

1043
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,039
Extremely very much

1044
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:58,879
And I'm using it all the time everywhere

1045
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
And

1046
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:05,279
I am constantly making sure trying to ensure that it's behaviour

1047
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
Remains

1048
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,631
Yeah remains stable

1049
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:13,471
But also becomes sort of surprising like

1050
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,567
Just adding this value request ID

1051
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,919
If you if you look at Sermon distributor

1052
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,943
And

1053
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,735
Let's close out here

1054
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
This is again

1055
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,087
This is not only for custom fields

1056
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
But since we are on

1057
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:37,023
This explore process if we go to main menu

1058
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,583
And let's say we wanna create a

1059
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:46,239
Field for the sermon menu sorry and let's say we gonna do

1060
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:48,287
Series

1061
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:54,687
now you see that there is a whole bunch of values here

1062
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,711
Look at that

1063
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,527
Whole bunch of values

1064
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,319
From sermon distributor

1065
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,623
In relation to the series

1066
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:09,791
And they all said Global Panel Box I mean this is a stunning feature right and it's

1067
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,071
Very easy to do

1068
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:17,983
Because all that I had to do to get those features there is to take this list query ID

1069
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,567
This value

1070
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,455
Is what actually makes this a selectable item

1071
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:29,503
In the menu so if I

1072
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
Go back here

1073
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,879
You see I have a series and you can select

1074
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
Test

1075
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,999
The way that JCB set this selection option up

1076
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:43,071
Is just by me adding this

1077
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,607
Request ID

1078
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:45,887
to

1079
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,423
To this field name

1080
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,727
Ok that's how that happened

1081
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,799
Now how did I get all the rest of the values

1082
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:55,103
These on the page as well

1083
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,639
Let me show you

1084
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,175
the way to get

1085
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,247
All the fields that you add to the config

1086
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,551
for example this

1087
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:07,391
We were looking at which one were we looking at the series

1088
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:10,975
The way to get all the series

1089
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,999
Fields

1090
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:13,279
That your add here

1091
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:19,167
To show at the menu is the fact that this name matches the site name

1092
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,471
That's how it works

1093
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,775
And if there is a field here

1094
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:28,127
That you do not want to actually have load here

1095
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:32,223
There is a way to do that so I'm gonna demonstrate that quickly

1096
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,295
As part of custom fields in a way

1097
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:40,159
So let's say I don't want them to set the default icon here anymore

1098
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:45,023
Then I want it always just fall back on the global

1099
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:48,607
Then I can actually

1100
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:50,399
Go to

1101
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,215
Let's see close out here

1102
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,567
Here is the series default icon

1103
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,919
I can scroll down and there is this

1104
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,455
Extra properties

1105
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,503
I can say add

1106
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:08,319
I can select display

1107
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:15,231
Now display switch for dynamic placement in relation to use of the field in menu and global

1108
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,767
configuration options

1109
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:22,911
So the config option will only add the field to the global configuration area

1110
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:29,311
Many will add the field only to the menu area and if you don't add this it will add to both

1111
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:32,895
So if we only want it to be in the config area

1112
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:35,711
We basically just add this value here

1113
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
Now

1114
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:41,087
Let's save and close and compile to show you

1115
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,111
How it 

1116
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:43,135
Took it out

1117
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:58,239
and now let's go back there and let's create

1118
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
a new menu

1119
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,823
That's again look at

1120
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,639
sermon Distributors series

1121
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,967
And now we see that the

1122
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:11,295
Icon is missing here no longer showing up

1123
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,391
Where are we

1124
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:19,743
If we go to the sermon distributor global area

1125
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,279
And to series

1126
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:23,583
We'd see that the icon is still there

1127
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,399
So all the rest of these values

1128
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,679
are

1129
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,495
Showing except this one and this one

1130
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,799
Ok so

1131
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:35,615
Now let's Tweak A Little More

1132
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,455
Let's instead of config

1133
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:44,063
Let's say only menu I want value only in menu save

1134
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,623
And then compile

1135
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:50,463
It install then go here refresh

1136
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,767
And there we have it

1137
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:54,047
Now it's here

1138
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:57,375
And if we go back to sermon distributor and refresh

1139
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
It's no longer here

1140
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,335
So that's how you can control

1141
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:12,735
The reason why all these buttons are here is because it's under this tab the reason why all these buttons are here it's because

1142
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:19,135
It is this this view name series's is the same as this tab name series's

1143
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,535
That is how the connection is made that's how the buttons gets move and if you

1144
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,839
Don't want a button here

1145
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,607
Then

1146
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,887
This extra

1147
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Display

1148
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:35,775
Option here can toggle where you want that button to show up

1149
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,639
And is to say none will let the button show up on both

1150
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,991
Ok well we're almost over an hour now

1151
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:51,391
I've said quite a lot of things I don't know hopefully this will help you understand little more about custom 

1152
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:54,207
Fields and it's amazing

1153
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,535
Agility and ability

1154
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,863
To bring relationships together

1155
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:05,215
Let me think is there something else

1156
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:09,055
Yeah there is one more thing let me do that

1157
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:12,383
In the components admin

1158
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,151
View

1159
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,527
You can add what we call a linked view

1160
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,319
Right

1161
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:22,879
So I am doing that here

1162
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,463
In the sermons

1163
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:31,327
Basically in the preacher Admin View I am linking the sermon

1164
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,143
On tap 2 so I'm giving it the name

1165
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,423
And

1166
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,727
Did the child key

1167
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,823
That means the place where we getting the data

1168
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,407
No no wait a minute

1169
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:49,247
The the one who

1170
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,391
The

1171
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,439
View is sermon

1172
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:02,303
And in the Sermon table there is a column called preacher

1173
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,375
And that column preacher

1174
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:09,471
Is a custom field right

1175
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:14,079
And we decided that that custom Fields save the ID

1176
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:18,431
Of the preacher so the field name is

1177
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:22,783
Therefore preacher where is the value in the current

1178
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,551
Table

1179
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,343
Which is again here

1180
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Preacher

1181
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,439
Is going to be the ID right

1182
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:33,023
This is the relationship between these two areas

1183
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:36,095
And then the placement

1184
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:38,399
Whether is going to have what kind of button

1185
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:45,055
Add new new and close button or add new or close button or just a new button

1186
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,383
These are some of the features that is available

1187
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:50,943
So

1188
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:58,367
Now sometimes it happens that you have a multiple selection and you still want to

1189
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,671
Set this relationship

1190
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:07,071
So there is a way to do that if it's a multiple selection so let's say this sermon could belong to more than one

1191
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:11,423
Preacher which in this case is not but let's just for a moment say it can

1192
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,727
Then you could do this. Wait.

1193
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,895
That

1194
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:29,343
Just that without anything else that will mean that it will now check whether

1195
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:33,183
This ID is in the array of this value

1196
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:35,743
If this array is a

1197
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:42,911
Associative array so let's say you have the value but it's in an associative array

1198
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,935
And

1199
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,495
Dissociation is maybe

1200
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:53,919
Key then you do that so if the array looks like this

1201
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:56,223
So if it looks like that

1202
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
Then

1203
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,295
You wanna target that area

1204
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,575
Then you would do

1205
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,599
The key

1206
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,439
If you are targeting a 

1207
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
More than one

1208
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:15,167
Value so if it's this or that one

1209
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:17,727
We have an one called or

1210
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
So it could be

1211
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:24,383
Preacher or

1212
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,431
Let's say maybe have a teacher

1213
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,759
You can say or

1214
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:34,879
Servant

1215
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,439
Maybe these are the columns

1216
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,743
That mapped to this ID

1217
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,535
You can have the or

1218
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,559
In there

1219
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:45,375
And it can link multiple values

1220
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:52,543
But ok I think I'm going way over the edge here it's not really custom code

1221
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,359
The custom Fields so much there but

1222
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:00,223
Because custom fields are the majority of the time used

1223
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:02,527
To set up this relationship right

1224
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,599
You you set up these relationships

1225
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,391
With custom fields

1226
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:10,463
That is where that

1227
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:12,511
Livability comes in

1228
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
And

1229
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:17,119
The linking of a table into another one

1230
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655
Ok

1231
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,447
Well thanks for watching

1232
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:25,055
In an hour of your time hope it's been worth it

1233
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
Thank you. Ok bye.
