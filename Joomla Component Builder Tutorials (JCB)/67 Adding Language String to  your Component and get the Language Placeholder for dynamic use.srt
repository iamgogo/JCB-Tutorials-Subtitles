1
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:03,072
This is a quick

2
00:00:03,328 --> 00:00:06,400
Sort of tip on how to add a language string

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:07,936
To your component

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
Without a language string

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:13,568
Being immediately

6
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:16,640
Added to the J text

7
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:18,688
Object function

8
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,248
Which translates it of course

9
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,600
So let me demonstrate

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,464
So normal language string you use this J text

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:32,000
And you'd

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
Add your string in there

13
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,864
And then JCB when it compiles

14
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:38,400
It

15
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:40,960
Actually adds that string to your language file

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,336
And then when your component runs that string is translated

17
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
because it has a

18
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,664
Placeholder in its place

19
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:54,272
And you can then have multiple places where the string is used

20
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,552
So that's

21
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,880
Already there and works well the new feature

22
00:00:59,392 --> 00:00:59,904
Is

23
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:03,488
Mostly used when you are dealing with a class

24
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,024
And you working with a

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,048
Array

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,584
In the class

27
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,120
And If

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,448
You want to have class method or rather

29
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,984
Fields

30
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,544
That is an array of

31
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,872
Strings but you can't of course use this

32
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
In the array of a class

33
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,504
Value so

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
That is one place but there are many places

35
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,928
Where you could see this in action

36
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,792
So what you would wanna do is you want the placeholder to be generated

37
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:40,096
You want the

38
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,656
String to be added to the language file

39
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:47,776
But you only want a placeholder as a string to be added to your

40
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:48,544
Script

41
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:52,384
Because only later in the script you're going to add it 

42
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:56,224
 to the Jtext

43
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,320
Option to translate this place holder

44
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:05,440
And so often you we would run into such a case well I have in anyway so

45
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,720
The way we've

46
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,768
 addressed this

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,560
Is with a new

48
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
Basically a new name

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Just text

50
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Like that

51
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
so

52
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:19,776
This part looks exactly the same as the J text

53
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:24,640
So this almost seems like this is a class but it's not really it's just

54
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:28,224
Something that the JCB compiler will pick up

55
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,320
And it'll convert this let me show you how it will look when it

56
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
has converted it

57
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:39,488
And you'll see why it makes sense you see I've got this extra field Properties

58
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,024
And it's got these

59
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,048
Keys

60
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
And I want to use the key to get the string

61
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:48,192
So if we go a little lower in the script

62
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:51,520
You see I'm here I'm looping through that

63
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,544
array

64
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:53,824
And

65
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,616
The value description

66
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:59,200
I'm only here passing it to the J text

67
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,736
To translate it

68
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,016
So that means

69
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,344
I wanna do the this translating later

70
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,720
And I actually all I want in this array above here is actually the placeholder string

71
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:14,560
So let me show you that in the code how it actually comes out

72
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:21,216
So in the code here you see the extra field properties and you see it's simply a

73
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:23,008
 a string

74
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,080
It actually took away the bracket here

75
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:29,152
 if you look at the way it was

76
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,200
So I'm going to paste in the

77
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
The one from the code

78
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
Just so that you can

79
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
see

80
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:36,832
What it's done

81
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
So here you can see

82
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,232
This is what we added in JCB

83
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,280
And this is what it did

84
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,560
In compilation

85
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,376
It added the placeholder string

86
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,704
Which we can then use

87
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,728
Down here

88
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,544
In our Jtext

89
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:59,104
To translate it to get the

90
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,896
Specific translated string

91
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:07,552
So that's a way to get the placeholder and to get obviously the string into your language file

92
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:12,672
That's just a little tip I know that

93
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:13,952
It's not very obvious

94
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,815
So I hope it will come in handy to those of you who want to add language strings

95
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,095
To JCB

96
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:23,679
But you don't want to have it immediately be

97
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,263
Part of the  Jtext object

98
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:31,871
Call you want to just have the actual placeholder available

99
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,919
for use dynamically

100
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,967
This is the way you can do that

101
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,783
Thanks for watching enjoy
