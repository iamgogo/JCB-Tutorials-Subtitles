Hi I would like to quickly give you a tutorial on how to now do the tabs

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,728
I realise there's been a little change and how tabs are made

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,872
So you go to admin view and you then open the admin View

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,408
An in the admin View

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,456
You actually have

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,736
A place called settings

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:28,160
And if you scroll down a little there you can create tabs so you could create any

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
Any amount of tabs here

9
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:38,912
Let's say anymore or many ok and if you click save then you

10
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,448
Basically have 4 tabs

11
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,752
And the change we've made

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:45,312
Is if you go I'll go to the

13
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
The fields

14
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,480
Obvious gonna ask that your first save those tabs because if you don't save them they're not in the database

15
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:56,576
But now in the tabs menu you would have all those tabs as a drop down

16
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,744
The other side is also true and that is if you have no tabs setup so

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,048
Let me quickly remove those

18
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
Just

19
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,376
Take them all away

20
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
and click save it now there's no tabs if I now go and 

21
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Open the fields

22
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,576
It actually doesn't have any tabs it only shows details

23
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,856
Because every

24
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,440
Thing will now show only in the Details tab

25
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:40,096
So to have more than details as a option for tabs you need to add in the settings area

26
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:43,424
There is a place which says tab setup

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,192
Options

28
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,752
And you just click on this plus sign here

29
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:52,384
And an add your settings right here

30
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
Ok

31
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,456
I hope that will help
