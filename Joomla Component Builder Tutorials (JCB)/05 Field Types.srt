1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:04,352
If you have a good knowledge of Joomla's API

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:09,728
You will know that it has a means by which it builds its forms

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:13,568
The forms that you use in your component

4
00:00:13,824 --> 00:00:18,432
And it's basically done through what is called the XML file

5
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:22,528
Now I can show you that XML file but maybe this is

6
00:00:22,784 --> 00:00:24,064
a little bit Too Soon

7
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:26,624
So all I'll tell you is that

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,464
Component builder basically builds that XML file

9
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:33,024
And place it in in the right place

10
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,840
So that your model

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
View and controller

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:39,680
Can access that file

13
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
Through the Joomla API

14
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:47,104
And with it builds the fields which you would use in a view

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:48,384
So

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,456
we Need to define a few terms what is a view

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
What is a field

18
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,528
What is a component

19
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,576
All those kind of things so

20
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,160
We would like to start with what is known as field types

21
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,256
There is always a field type needed

22
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,304
If you are building a field

23
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:13,216
Field types if we were to just go to Joomla itself and maybe create a new article

24
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:18,080
You basically this is what we would call a view

25
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360
In fact even the

26
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,176
URL which I suppose you can't see

27
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
let me Scroll down a bit there

28
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,528
URL says that it's in a view

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,832
View equals article

30
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Ok so

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,416
This is an article View

32
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,256
If you close this and you see a list of

33
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,072
Oh there's no articles here it's a blank website

34
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,168
Then this is a list of articles and it's articles are plural

35
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:47,008
So if you create one it's article single

36
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,336
And if it's the list of the articles it's plural

37
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
Both of these are seen as views

38
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,688
So this is the

39
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:55,968
List View

40
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
And if you click on new

41
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
This is the what we call the edit view or the Single View

42
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
So

43
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:08,768
Your components mostly will have these two views in the backend

44
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,328
When it comes to your different datasets

45
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:12,864
Now

46
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,448
This title here is what we would call a text view

47
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,264
the alias here is also a text view

48
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,384
This editor block here is what we would call there sorry not text View

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,688
I mean text field

50
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:34,112
And this editor here is also called a text editor field

51
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,648
This is a

52
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:36,416
List

53
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,696
Field

54
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,744
This is a radio

55
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,792
Field another list field

56
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:44,864
Another list field this is a tag field

57
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,680
This is a text field

58
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
And so you have all these fields

59
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
This is a

60
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,800
Date field

61
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
This is a user field

62
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,480
This is a text field

63
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:01,760
Is a text

64
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:03,552
Area

65
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:04,832
Text area

66
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
Text field

67
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:06,624
List

68
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,952
So we can continue this is a

69
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:13,792
Normal text field but that's got a certain feature called

70
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,328
Read only

71
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
Added to it

72
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,472
As we will see these things are all in place in our application

73
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:26,592
For you to make use of all these different changes that can be made with one type of field

74
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:32,224
So these are all seen as Fields and they all live inside a view

75
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:36,576
So that's one concept that is quite important for you to realise

76
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,184
That you have Fields which live in views now

77
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,256
You might not think that the list view has

78
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
Fields and you're partly right it more displays these fields

79
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,192
Let's do a dummy

80
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,008
test article here

81
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,616
Hi I think that's about all I need to fill in save and close

82
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,224
So we at least have a list item

83
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,040
But that is also a field

84
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,904
That is a field and if you are to click on search options all these are fields

85
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
And

86
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,047
So your list view also has certain Fields which are primarily

87
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
Only available in the list view. The list view is also the place where we do most of our

88
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:30,847
Features for a multiple items where as opening one item

89
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:33,663
you do what's only required for one item

90
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:39,551
Ok and then there is obviously a table here which is part of the list view

91
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,183
now Component builder sets Up the back end List view and edit view for you

92
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:50,559
Based on the fields and how you map them into your view

93
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,887
We will look at each of those concepts

94
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:54,911
More

95
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,679
Deeply

96
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,031
But I need to have you understand from which angle we are coming

97
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,311
We are

98
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,847
Gonna try and

99
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Show you

100
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
That inside of

101
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
This article

102
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,831
You will be creating Fields even put them into different tabs

103
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
Which will eventually be rendered in a specific order in Joomla in in the component when it's been

104
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:22,815
Compiled through component Builder

105
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,607
So

106
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:28,191
That's using Joomla's own

107
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,031
Article manager as sort of an example

108
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
But we could just as well

109
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,871
Go onto component Builder

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:42,271
Since it has the demo article sorry the demo application in it we can select the demo

111
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Compile it

112
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:50,975
It says that there's a copy warning this is because we haven't set some options in the global settings

113
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
It doesn't mean that there's been an error in the compiling it just means it couldn't move the file to the Git repository

114
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:01,983
You see we selected this Git thing here

115
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,031
And also that one

116
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:08,639
If we've unselected those let's start again

117
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:13,247
let me unselect those and we only do a compile

118
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
You see it doesn't give you the same warning

119
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,159
Because it's not trying to move things around

120
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,439
And since that

121
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,767
it couldn't move the others because they are Global figures

122
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
Settings that we haven't set

123
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,863
We'll look at those in a moment

124
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
So

125
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,703
Now we could just click install

126
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
And it is installed the component

127
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,335
Into this Joomla site

128
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:44,735
Now as you'll see it doesn't have any images because we don't ship the images with the components

129
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,039
that are sent as demo

130
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,063
So

131
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:52,927
Unfortunately at this stage we might change that in the future

132
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
But you already have your demo component running

133
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:59,583
If you click on add a look

134
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
It will open the edit view if you click looks It will open a list view of where the looks will be displayed

135
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:10,591
We added an import feature which your normal Joomla

136
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Components don't have

137
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,687
We will explain that

138
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Later

139
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,759
But we click new

140
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:22,367
You'd see that we have a text field here a radio button if I

141
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:26,207
Add something to the textfield it opens an alias field

142
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,743
Also text field

143
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,791
We have a repeatable field

144
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:31,839
in here

145
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:36,191
And we can add information to this

146
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,007
And that is sort of

147
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,287
Look at

148
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,103
The fields that is in the demo component

149
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
And so these are all fields

150
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,991
And they are mapped into the component

151
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,551
Through Joomla's infrastructure that

152
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,087
If we go to

153
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:54,879
Admin views

154
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,927
There is Look

155
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,719
if you look

156
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
It has in it

157
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,839
Those Fields we just looked at

158
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:04,607
Right

159
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
there's the name

160
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,751
There is the earliest acronym all this information

161
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
We just looked at

162
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:12,799
And

163
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:16,127
They are all mapped into this view

164
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,943
Through the field add button here

165
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Reason why these two are Why you're not adding in through this area is because this simply is to edit

166
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,623
Existing

167
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
fields

168
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
Instead of adding them

169
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
So if you were to open an admin view you can edit them from here and it's maybe easier to get to those

170
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Fields especially

171
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
If you

172
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,703
Have many components already

173
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
You'll have many Fields and this is a way to

174
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,127
Sort of just look at the fields related to this component's view

175
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Ok so

176
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:56,575
If you were to add more Fields you would open this box and this is where you'll be adding Fields I see we are missing

177
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
One

178
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,647
Possibly I need to

179
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:02,975
Ensure that it's with the export and it's been dropped ou

180
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,279
I'll look at that

181
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Ok

182
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,911
Now let's step back to

183
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:13,471
Field types

184
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
Because that's really where it all starts

185
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
We've already added

186
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,127
All the field types that I think you would need

187
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
The field types are

188
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,711
Basically

189
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:28,063
Mapping to the libraries inside of Joomla

190
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,135
Joomla has many field types

191
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,207
And for each field type which you build

192
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:39,071
You need to set certain values in an XML document

193
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,863
These values are

194
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,703
for example if you with use checkbox

195
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:46,239
Set

196
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,775
Up in Properties

197
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,567
So

198
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
You have these

199
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:57,759
Be certain changing properties that you can adjust for each

200
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:58,783
field

201
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
So this is

202
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
This is only the properties for

203
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:04,927
the checkbox field

204
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
Now you might wonder if you need to set these and most of the time you would never need to do that unless you become advanced

205
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,191
You would want to add more field types which we haven't covered

206
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,287
Or if you want to extend the existing field types

207
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,615
But for the most part you would not probably need to

208
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,407
You know tinker with this

209
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:28,479
I am simply trying to explain to you where

210
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,503
field type

211
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
comes from and

212
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,831
Amazing

213
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
Scalability that exists

214
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,975
You see with most other component

215
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,071
Builders you need to wait for the developer to add a new field type

216
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:48,703
Where as in this one you can add your own field type which simply needs to map to Joomla's

217
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,239
Library

218
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,799
And the way that they have their field type set

219
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:58,175
Now there are certain few types like repeatable field which is quite tricky and

220
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:02,015
Needs special attention even in the code of the compiler

221
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
But the majority of field types are very straight forward and simple to implement and we have implemented

222
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,951
those already

223
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:15,327
We have not implemented all the attributes that can be targeted though

224
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:20,703
And those would be the ones that you might need to come and add if you want to use them for example

225
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,751
I added this showon

226
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,287
option

227
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,871
quite recently to old field types which I found

228
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,015
Because this is a way of showing and hiding Fields based on other Fields' values

229
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,831
And although we have a very excellent

230
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,951
Application in place in component builder to take control of those

231
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:43,231
Features

232
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
of showing and hiding fields

233
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:52,191
This is an added feature which Joomla itself actually has and if we can in a component

234
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:58,591
That we are developing if we can use show on instead of the component Builders version

235
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:01,407
I would obviously suggest we do that

236
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,783
And none the less I would still explain much more on this topic as we continue

237
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
So just

238
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,135
Briefly let me start here at the top

239
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
You have name which is called type

240
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,767
And a value for checkbox

241
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
And it

242
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:23,167
Must be set to not adjustable because that is the way Joomla expects it

243
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:27,519
If you don't understand any of this information that I'm showing you here

244
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
Then a place to go to

245
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,615
Is this URL

246
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,455
Let me open that for you

247
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:40,575
It's called the form fields

248
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:45,695
You'd see a whole list of form Fields and these are the same form Fields you just saw

249
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,999
In our application

250
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
If I was to take

251
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,119
Checkbox (where is it?)

252
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:54,911
Up

253
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
here it is checkbox

254
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,519
Checkboxes

255
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823


256
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,943
Ok if I would open that you'd see that they give you a list of those

257
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Fields type

258
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:10,783
Name and they tell you what is mandatory

259
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
And what is optional

260
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,879
And basically we are just mapping those

261
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,647
Data

262
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,183
Into this

263
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
form here

264
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:24,863
And if we wanna add another attribute you just click on the + and it creates a new field and we add the name add

265
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:28,191
The value tweak these switches in correspondence

266
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
And some information

267
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:33,311
This is really for yourself this information block here

268
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:39,967
We put information there when later when you use this field type you are reminded what this specific attribute is for.

269
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,319
And I basically took this information

270
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,087
by

271
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,391
Copying it right here from

272
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
Joomla's website and placed it in there

273
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:55,839
And where I felt there might be more said I added some customs text to it

274
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:01,983
And what these values will do is it'll create an XML string like that

275
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,287
In your form

276
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
Which Joomla then uses to build those forms

277
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,895
So

278
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:12,735
Basically we first setup a field Type by

279
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
Telling you

280
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Which input

281
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Values would be able to use for the specific field type which at this stage is

282
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,719
Check boxes

283
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,535
And then we save this

284
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,143
And then later you can reuse this field type when you start creating fields

285
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,239
So let me just close this check box

286
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
And go to text field

287
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,575
And you'll see that here is a

288
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
List of the fields

289
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:53,439
That used text field as its type

290
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
Now you can open one of these fields

291
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:04,959
And here the bottom you see very something very similar if I was to go back here

292
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,263
And go to text field

293
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,151
on Joomla's website

294
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:19,295
You see that it shows you examples of how that XML line should look right see

295
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
Now

296
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
here

297
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
In the

298
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:25,439
Field area where you've created the field

299
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:29,535
Basically gave the field the name this is just for the system

300
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,375
The name used here is the one that is important

301
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,447
That should be the correct name the label

302
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:40,031
This name is just that you when you add it to your view

303
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:43,103
You know this is what we use to identify it

304
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,919
We'll still explain adding it to the view

305
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:47,455
In more detail

306
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,111
This data type and things will also explain when we go into more depth around

307
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:57,439
What a field is and how to build one

308
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:04,095
I'm simply now looking at few types and showing you how the changes that you've made in field type

309
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
affects

310
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:08,191
fields that you would build with that type

311
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
So here is that

312
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:13,055
Detail that was in field type

313
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,847
remember on change

314
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
And it tells you

315
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,039
What is mandatory and what is optional but that's basically because I placed it in the description right

316
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:26,879
I mean let's we can click close to go back to that field type

317
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,231
And then click on property

318
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:35,583
And we'll see that I added optional and mandatory

319
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:37,119
To the description

320
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:40,447
So that I can know is this optional or mandatory

321
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Yes you could

322
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:47,871
Possibly argue that I should have done it from here and that it's not shouldn't be necessary to add it there

323
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,199
But you know this

324
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,295
settings here is used when we compile the component

325
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,831
Where as this

326
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
Here is used for you

327
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,207
to know what this field attribute is all about

328
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:04,511
And maybe as we

329
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:07,327
Continue to develop this component I might

330
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:08,607
Make a change to that

331
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,215
But I wouldn't make such a change that it affects anything that already exists

332
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:16,031
Dramatically in any way

333
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,103
Ok so let's go back to a field

334
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,343
The way the compiler works it is doesn't really grab the string and just put it into the XML

335
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:33,439
In fact if I show you how a string looks that the compiler has built

336
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
Wrong window

337
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:40,095
Let's go to a string that the compiler has built

338
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,199
Assessment type

339
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,527
You'd see that it is completely reformatted

340
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:02,367
The label is turned into a translatable string

341
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,439
So as has been done with the description

342
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:11,583
It also tells you where in the compiler if well we'll still look at that because this might

343
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
Sometimes show and sometimes you can

344
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:14,911
Tweak

345
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Your

346
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
Your component that it doesn't show it

347
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,567
But it tells you

348
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
you know in which line in the

349
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:28,735
Compiler it was built and also in which file which is very nice

350
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:34,879
I think those of you that are developers will appreciate this feature tremendously

351
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,183
It also tells you the field types

352
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,511
Obviously as you can see as we scroll through this

353
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
You can see that

354
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,143
Component builder really goes way out of its way to

355
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,679
Reconstruct

356
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,727
That

357
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,263
That field

358
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,823
It is not using

359
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,615
This directly

360
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:57,663
It in fact

361
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:58,943
Grabs

362
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
That area

363
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,759
And that

364
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,063
To determine that this is a

365
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Text

366
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:05,599
Field

367
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,695
So it actually is really dependent on that part

368
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,279
Which is up to name come now

369
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
And

370
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,583
That part there

371
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,143
So the opening

372
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:22,495
Exclamation and the closing one

373
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:25,823
And the value in between those is what is used

374
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,175
So if you by accident drop off this

375
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:34,783
Or that it will still work perfectly

376
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,831
These are really the only

377
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Things that are

378
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,391
Really needed

379
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:41,439
And part of what I am

380
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:47,583
Hoping to achieve eventually is that this becomes just input Fields Like These

381
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:51,935
And yet I'm wondering if I should go that way

382
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,007
The fact that they all in one big text area

383
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,103
Leaves us with a lot of room and freedom

384
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:04,223
to really adjust it easily without major

385
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,503
Complications

386
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:10,111
And any case if you start a new field which we'll look at later

387
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,975
It populates this with the demo data and the demo data

388
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,023
Is actually values that you set

389
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:19,071
When you create a field type

390
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
You see

391
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,655
there it is the demo is this

392
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
Value or example

393
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
That is placed here

394
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:31,615
It's from these values that it region if you create a new text field

395
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:36,223
It grabs these values as the values which you can then

396
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,783
Adjust to your purpose

397
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,063
Of you know

398
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:43,391
Implementation for that specific field at that moment

399
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,999
If you leave it blank it will also build it without any value

400
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Between those two

401
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Exclamation marks

402
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,607
Ok

403
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,191
That is looking at field types

404
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,031
I'm not gonna spend much more time on this

405
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,103
Primarily because all the field types has been setup

406
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
And you hardly ever would need to come here and change things unless you really wanna do your own thing

407
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:13,855
And then you will be able to do that without my help I suppose

408
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:19,744
So our next tutorial will be on how to use field types in

409
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,512
Fields

410
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Thank you for watching
