1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,584
Ok we gonna look at setting up layouts now

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:06,400
And we setting up layouts you have

3
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:10,496
Some nice ways to reuse code across multiple

4
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:13,568
 templates or or site views

5
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:19,200
and one of the things that I found is that I would like to know which template or

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,272
Not Not really which tampered rather which side view

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,320
Is actually calling the layout

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:28,160
So that all the bases of that I could use Global settings

9
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,720
That are related that specific site View

10
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,304
So what I've done is I've just in the dynamic get

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:36,608
I've added little string

12
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:40,960
Since each Dynamic get Targets only a specific site View

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:42,496
So if I was to open

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:45,056
Sermon preacher ID

15
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,872
Which is primarily gonna be used in

16
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,664
Preacher side view

17
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
If I look at the custom script

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,296
You see that I added a view key called preacher

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,648
And by doing that I know ok since this Dynamic get

20
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,952
Is only used in the preacher view

21
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,536
That when the layout is called and

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
I'm in my component I'm only passing

23
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
The item

24
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
So not the whole list of items but just one item

25
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
To the layout

26
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:20,128
That helps me to know ok this this specific item is calling from preacher

27
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,408
And I can on that

28
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,176
Basis

29
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:24,736
You know do certain implementation

30
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,576
To ensure that the layout displays in the way I expected

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,208
So that's just a little heads up on making your layouts even more

32
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488
Dynamic

33
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,304
Then going to the template

34
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
We will open

35
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
Your

36
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
The layout

37
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:48,288
Sorry the template that calls the layout so we wanna see that initial setup

38
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,384
and one of the templates that really

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,176
Illustrates this very well

40
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,480
Is this sermon list

41
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
So I'm gonna open sermon list

42
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,928
in sermon list you see that I'm looping through the items

43
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
And then

44
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,280
I am

45
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,816
adding

46
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:13,120
Some parameters to the item

47
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,656
Object

48
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:18,752
One of them is the Params the other is , I'm taking the description

49
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:25,152
And making sure that it's escaped and no longer than 19 characters

50
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:27,456
And then

51
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,016
I'm adding that back to the description 

52
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:30,784
without the full name

53
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:32,320
And

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
then adding that item

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,928
To the layout

56
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:39,744
Study class render

57
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,304
Layout help J layout helper

58
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
study class Render

59
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888


60
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,936


61
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
 sermon

62
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,496
List item as the layout name

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,336
Ok and that basically is gonna populate

64
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,640
The Script between

65
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,736
List items

66
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:06,368
That is gonna be placed in an unordered list on the Sermon list page

67
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,232
Ok so now let's go look at this specific layout

68
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Layout helper

69
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,560
Sermon list item

70
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,096
So

71
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,632
In layouts

72
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,680
Look for sermon

73
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:24,032
List item there we go

74
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:28,384
and in sermon list item

75
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
You see that I'm using that

76
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480
Global

77
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,344
The item that is being passed is placed inside of displayed data

78
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:41,696
I'm so now display data is basically

79
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,976
The item object

80
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,768
And since I

81
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:48,096
Placed the parameters in it so I can use different

82
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,376
Get method

83
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:52,192
With the specific Global

84
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:53,216
Field name

85
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,776
Which is set in the components Global settings

86
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
And since I'm

87
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:59,872
Targeting a specific layout

88
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
Sorry

89
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,176
View

90
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
I'm using the view key

91
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Adding it to the string and checking what is the value for this specific view in the globals of the component

92
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,160
And

93
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,696
On the basis of this

94
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:17,024
I'm actually able to make this view very dynamic

95
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,583
And can use it through multiple layouts

96
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:21,887
Based on that

97
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
View key

98
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
Now I know if others want to use the layout in their components extending this one it possibly

99
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
will not work that well

100
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
But since we are using it for our own component

101
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:39,039
And really for only implementation I don't think that's too big a deal

102
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,087
And

103
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:41,855
At the same

104
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,415
Token I am able to check

105
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
Simply what is the view key is it preacher series or category and on a basis of that I ask different

106
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:57,471
Questions that have different implementation of certain

107
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
Values like series name preacher name and category

108
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,199
And there is another Convention that I think is very worthwhile mentioning here

109
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:10,015
And that is the convention of actually

110
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,063
In the template

111
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,599
We go back here

112
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,159
And we go to custom scripting

113
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,207
There is the S

114
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,999
View placeholder

115
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
S view placeholder

116
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:24,351
Will be replaced

117
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:27,423
With the actual views name

118
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:29,983
Now since we using a template here

119
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,519
So you see this is a template

120
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,311
But this sermon list

121
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
That one

122
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,663
I'm adding that template

123
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
To multiple site views

124
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
So I'm not just adding it to one site view

125
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:45,343
I'm adding it to multiple site views

126
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
But since I want this template again to be Dynamic so wherever I add it I

127
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
I want it to dynamically

128
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Add

129
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
That site views name here

130
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,471
And then is as you can see I'm actually asking

131
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
The global parameters

132
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
For that site view sermon list style

133
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:08,383
So

134
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
That means

135
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,943
Is is going to add

136
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,343
For example preacher there or it's gonna add series there or is gonna add category there so it will say

137
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:22,975
 category sermons list style let me show you that in the code

138
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,071
So now I have category open

139
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
I've got preacher open as well as series

140
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
And you can see

141
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,519
That I'm adding sermon grit sermon list sermon table to them all

142
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:38,079
sermon grid sermon list sermon table

143
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,639
Sermon grit sermon list  sermon table

144
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
But if I was to open

145
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
Sermon list in series

146
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
You see that that name

147
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
was changed to Series

148
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
If I was gonna open

149
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
Sermon list in preacher

150
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
You see it was changed

151
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
Preacher

152
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,047
If I open it in category

153
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,679
You see that it actually added category

154
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:07,263
And that means that our Little Place holder

155
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:11,615
Was dynamically updated by component Builder on the build

156
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
And then

157
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,455
It behaves as you expect now

158
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
That you would know

159
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,063
 where is it getting these values

160
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:23,647
If we If we go to the component in the backend

161
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
And

162
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
We open it's config

163
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
File

164
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Scroll down

165
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:39,775
We get you an area called preacher custom config

166
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Which is again this is a tab

167
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,639
And tab's name is preacher

168
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,919
and in this tab

169
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,735
We have these value preacher display

170
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
preacherbox contrast

171
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:51,807
 preacher list style

172
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:56,415
And we scroll down we see preachers sermon count

173
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
preacher email Preacher website

174
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,303
and then preacher sermon display

175
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,631
And preacher a sermon list display

176
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,703
Now if we take that sermon List display

177
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,751
And then search for it

178
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
across

179
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,567
The file say make it

180
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:14,847
Cap sensitive

181
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
we see that it has 6 matches

182
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:20,223
So that means there is 6 places

183
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,015
Actually 3

184
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
Because one of

185
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,599
Each other 6 are in the comments

186
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:27,647
one is category

187
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,463
one is series

188
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
And one is

189
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
Preacher

190
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,583
So those are the different the three different views

191
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,655
Let make use of that series list style

192
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,959
Now the Series list style

193
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,263
Is then being implemented

194
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,799
On the basis of

195
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:48,127
That Dynamic updating of the string here

196
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,431
And so it's simply getting the style

197
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:53,247
Then doing a switch that when setting it accordingly

198
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
And that is

199
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Another nice

200
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,623
To have tool

201
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,671
To again make a template

202
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
More Dynamic so you can build a template

203
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,327
And you can reuse it in multiple site views

204
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,631
Simply with this place holders

205
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,519
Which is called site view ,I should have mentioned that in the templates

206
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Explanation

207
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:20,895
But since we only came across it now I mentioning it here

208
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:24,223
Going back to the layouts

209
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:27,039
Your layout

210
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
Concept is more or less the same as templates

211
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:34,719
It has a layout area in which you put your script and here you can see

212
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:36,255
We are using that key replacing

213
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,095


214
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:46,495
You can see that if you select certain Dynamic gets we are taking 

215
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:50,591
Liberty of showing you that we are starting with display data

216
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
But this this

217
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Snippets here

218
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,063
Might not correspond what you're doing because you can really pass anything to a layout

219
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:06,719
And we are just assuming that if you're using that dynamic get you possibly passing it in this

220
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
This way or that way

221
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,815
So you can't just copy paste this necessarily

222
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:15,679
But at least you can know when you look at a specific Dynamic get here

223
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
What are the values in it

224
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,799
And you know how you can sort of try figure out

225
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,335
Which ones to use here

226
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,151
This again will be only really

227
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,711
Something you need to use

228
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:32,575
If or can use if you are actually aware of our PHP and

229
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Everything will

230
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,415
Do the implementations here

231
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,743
And if you do not if you're not that familiar

232
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:44,863
You don't need layouts I mean you can you can build your whole front-end right in your site view

233
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:48,447
It might be a long lengthy script but it still work

234
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,335
All the only reason we added layouts and templates is simply for our own convenience

235
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:59,967
And if it's little confusing to you can even if you skip this whole area

236
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,503
For the meantime

237
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:06,111
Beginning layouts you have the same concept of adding custom scripting

238
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:09,183
Which will be placed in the head of the file

239
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:14,047
And remember that your Global data or in the data being passed is in

240
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
Display data

241
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,399
And then here again you have your 

242
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,935
HTML area

243
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,751
But you can jump into PHP and

244
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,871
Check the sum values and then on the basis of that to your certain implementations

245
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:29,919
And

246
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
That is really setting up a layout

247
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:36,063
Just another note you can actually use a layout in a layout

248
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,903
And you can pass it values

249
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
as any value you like

250
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,791
I realized that this here is maybe not that appropriate

251
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,119
So you need to keep a heads up that

252
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,679
This doesn't exist on the layout page

253
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
You need to use the

254
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,055
Display data as the global

255
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,335
or as the main

256
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:01,151
Object from which to start 

257
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Your implementation

258
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:06,527
OK that is layouts thank you for watching
