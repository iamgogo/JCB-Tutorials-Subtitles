1
00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:03,840
Now that we've added the admin views to the component

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:09,984
Let's look at some of the features that is still available inside of components

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,688
As you can see adding your custom admin views is done there

4
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,736
And the site views is done here

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,136
Then there is a custom admin menus now this this don't let this trough you out

6
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:30,720
Controlling the menu structures for these are

7
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:35,072
Custom admin views in the site views are done inside of these

8
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,888
This is if you are actually adding

9
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,680
Custom backend

10
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:40,960
Views

11
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:45,312
Which hasn't been developed inside of component Builder

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,616
So for example

13
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:51,200
Component builder its self has a compiler View

14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,248
You all have seen that

15
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:54,016
If I

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,296
quickly go there

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,856
It's this view here

18
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:02,208
Now this whole view is done outside of component Builder

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:03,744
I I actually

20
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,792
This is just hand coded little script

21
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:07,840
That kicks off a bunch of

22
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
Events now

23
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:15,264
It needs a model it needs a controller so I wrote that

24
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:17,568
With my hand know just manually

25
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
with hand coding

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:21,920
And it also needs a view

27
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,992
And so basically the view and everything

28
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,528
In regards to it

29
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,368
If you look at my infrastructure of component Builder

30
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:33,952
You would see

31
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:35,488
That

32
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
I have let me just look at this

33
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
compiler

34
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,704
I have a place called custom

35
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728
you see

36
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,776
Now Inside of custom

37
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
Is where everything that you want it into you know include inside of your component is added into the

38
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Custom folder

39
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
Any files any folders anything that you want to integrate is in here now you might look there

40
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,672
See there are a bunch of things already there

41
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
And I would encourage you not to remove them because depending on what you do in component builder it will

42
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
Automatically include those

43
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,424
Specially the the footables

44
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,728
And the import View

45
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
And the uikit and I think some

46
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
Not sure I think you would have sound manager as well

47
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,920
That is for sermon distributor

48
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,528
And in PHP Excel which is the use for the exporting

49
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:32,320
of data to spreadsheet and

50
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:34,880
Importing a from spreadsheet we using this

51
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:35,904
This library

52
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,720
So all of that is in the custom tab

53
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,792
And then he will see a bunch of files as well now the

54
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:45,120
Component builder itself has its

55
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,656
Compiler view here

56
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
So as you can see it's basically just empty folders

57
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,848
And then I have the actual files

58
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,432
Here is well there's the default compiler file

59
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,456
Which is

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,992
Then if I open it up

61
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:05,088
It's basically the The Script that shows the

62
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
That little dropdown of items

63
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,184
And I have

64
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
That in there

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
And

66
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
I also have the controller somewhere

67
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Let's Scroll down

68
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
Obviously it should

69
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,264
Compiler there's the controller

70
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
There's the model

71
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,128
There is the compiler as well

72
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:29,920
The helper

73
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
File

74
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,016
And so I am including that

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:36,064
Into my component

76
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,344
If we look here

77
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Let me open

78
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,232
Component builder quickly

79
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Go to settings

80
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
In files I'm including

81
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,288
A bunch of things adding and that also means I'm including that here it is the compiler

82
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:58,592
And I'm saying take this file

83
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,920
And put it in admin views compiler

84
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,944
And view

85
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,480
And rename it

86
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,528
See it's got the wrong name here

87
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,600
So if you add the right name at the end of the string

88
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,928
And click Yes it will rename that file to this

89
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
so that is adding custom

90
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,024
Files

91
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,047
And

92
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
As well as custom folders

93
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,143
So on

94
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:25,727
Grabbing the compiler views and I'm dumping it into views

95
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:30,591
And I'm also say rename it to compiler so compiler views becomes compiler

96
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Inside of the views folder

97
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
And then

98
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,247
Obviously we first the system will first build the folders

99
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:43,647
And then move your data your files to those folders so you you you will put the files here

100
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,255
And then have the system do the folders and then it will move the files

101
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:54,399
Ok so that's adding custom files to any component and this custom admin menu

102
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:56,703
Is basically what I use

103
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,287
to the map the compiler menu so I would say

104
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,359
I wanna call it compiler the code is compiler

105
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:09,759
I'm not using a link because it's not another extension or another website or something like that

106
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:11,551
Which you can also do

107
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
And then I would select an icon

108
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Here is the information

109
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:17,695
It's the same kind of switches

110
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,047
As you see with adding in custom admin sorry

111
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:28,447
A backend admin view you can tweak whether it should be an admin menu or be a dashboard

112
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
And be a sub menu

113
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
So you can tweak that

114
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
And then also in which order behind it says select before what admin View

115
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
This one

116
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,503
Should be placed

117
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:43,295
Now

118
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,135
That we are placing it before component

119
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,183
So that means it can

120
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:49,951
Go

121
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:51,231
at the very top

122
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,047
Ok so that is adding

123
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
An custom admin menu

124
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,423
Because of custom

125
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:02,751
Fields and files and folders that you have

126
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:06,335
Created by hand and are importing

127
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Into your component when you

128
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
compile it

129
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
The same is done with the compiler of component builder I'm actually including it as files so

130
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,855
There is the compiler let me see

131
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
Oh you know what I am I took

132
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:25,791
All the compiler

133
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,887
Files and I put it in the folder called compiler there it is

134
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:35,263
And so it's a folder which moves all the files at once that obviously can also be done

135
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Like for example as you see here

136
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
PHP

137
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,663
Excel

138
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,199
Which is a folder

139
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:46,527
Has a lot of content in it if we were to open it

140
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:52,159
You'd see all these files and folders and things

141
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
And so I put everything I wanted

142
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:56,255
To move Inside of this folder

143
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:00,607
And then in in my component I simply target that folder

144
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,143
And it pulls it in

145
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:04,191
Ok so that

146
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:08,543
That's simply showing you how I have added a whole lot of folders to

147
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,847
To component Builder

148
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,919
And then

149
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:18,015
When I need a backend admin view custom

150
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,831
Added this feature here does that for me

151
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:25,183
Now I also want to quickly cover the

152
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
The area called config

153
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:32,095
Is it this area deals with something that is actually

154
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,375
quite

155
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,399
Useful

156
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,703
And that is to set up your

157
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Back end

158
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,311
Global fields

159
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Now

160
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,383
It let me go out of this one

161
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:49,247
because it's definitely not the best in demonstration let me go to sermon distributor

162
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,063
There we've done some really amazing things

163
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,367
sermon distributor

164
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
Settings and then config

165
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:09,215
And as you can see it is a very long list of things

166
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,823
But then if we go to

167
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
The actual component

168
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
It me open it

169
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:21,759
And then I'll click on options

170
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,927
You see that has many many tabs

171
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:34,559
Ok all of these switches

172
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:37,375
Are done in the config area

173
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,495
All of them except some of these default switch

174
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Is added by the

175
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,079
simple switches

176
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:50,687
For example the global timer remember we spoke about the check-in

177
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:56,319
here you can set it all whether it should be every 5 hours 12 hours once a day every second day once a week or never

178
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,463
Checking in your items automatically the version control buttons are added automatically as well

179
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:06,559
Which means the person can set the version control on or off

180
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
And also said how many

181
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679
You know records should be set

182
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
if zero

183
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
Then all versions will be saved

184
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:18,079
So this is the version control

185
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,127
And then

186
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
The author

187
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
Areas also added automatically

188
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,063
And you can when you click in the component here

189
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,623
just close this thing

190
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
You see here is a contributing in area you can set whether you want add empty contributing level

191
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:47,519
The fields

192
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Here you can add contributors as many as you like

193
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
Those involved in developing the component

194
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,271
And then the amount of empty ones you want to leave there

195
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
Is also

196
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,575
Tweak able

197
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,367
And that'll basically

198
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,439
Let me show you add this area here

199
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:09,023
Contributor 1234

200
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
And

201
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
When you use this witch

202
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:17,471
IT controls whether it's been shown in the back or the front of all these kind of features

203
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,031
Which I am not gonna go into much depth now

204
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:26,175
But they also added automatically on also the permissional and structure is added automatically

205
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
And if you have in the component

206
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
You can actually

207
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,855
Set that it includes UiKit

208
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
you can said to that: yes

209
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:36,927
If you do that

210
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,743
it automatically adds This feature

211
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:42,303
to your component

212
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:44,863
And every where where Uikid is used

213
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,519
Ok so everything else this Dropbox preachers preacher categories category

214
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,103
Series list and series and sermons

215
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,407
Is all done through that

216
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,687
Config

217
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
area here

218
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
Now to use to add Fields to the config area you first need to add that field

219
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,391
To fields

220
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
So you would you go to fields

221
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,815
And whatever field you wanna use there you need to create here

222
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
So you first create the fields

223
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:21,983
Then obviously you need to remember the system name that you're using

224
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,543
Because then when you open up this

225
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,591
You would be able to

226
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:27,871
Type in the name

227
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:29,407
And it will be selected

228
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,247
And then by Convention that tab name

229
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,391
As long as you use the same tab name it will be bundled in the order of which you said it here

230
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:42,207
So this is where the Dropbox

231
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,487
Area

232
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
All there

233
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,559
Fields are being set

234
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:50,911
Now the reason why we include this

235
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:51,935
Demo

236
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:52,959
Component

237
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Into the

238
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Application with the tutorial

239
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,639
Is that you can go and look and see ok well he's using

240
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:02,943
Dropbox update method

241
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Here

242
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
And

243
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:07,295
Then you can go look at this file

244
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:09,599
And then you can go look at

245
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,415
And how it looks here

246
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:15,231
The Dropbox update method

247
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:19,071
And the files and the text and even

248
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:22,143
Some of this I mean here is a button

249
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
If I click it

250
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:26,495
It starts an update

251
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
And it even shows it here

252
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:34,943
Now how to do this is very tricky

253
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
It's not that simple to do that because we not inside of our component as you can see were actually in the config

254
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,111
Component

255
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
In the global if you have Global settings

256
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
So

257
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:52,607
This whole feature that is building into sermon distributor is so smart I would tell you

258
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
For you to be able to do that is just stunning

259
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
So

260
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,799
You can look at how I've done that by Simply going to the

261
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
To these fields

262
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
And you would find

263
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:08,479
The answer to how did he do that

264
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,599
And you can look at these things in this list View

265
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:15,647
All the Dropbox

266
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,183
Information is there

267
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
And then there is some Global

268
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
Like local folder download link

269
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,607
And then space hr

270
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
You can see that I have that Space HR quite often it's a It's a field that it will be included in

271
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,311
the Paid

272
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:34,591
version of

273
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:36,895
of component builder

274
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:40,991
It already has that spacer hr in it

275
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:45,599
And since Spacers you can use the same spacer

276
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,743
Over and over the system automatically increment it so it doesn't have conflict in name conventions

277
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:58,143
So I'm just using the Same Spacer so every where is putting spacers which is which is this

278
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Little

279
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:00,959
Line

280
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
you see that line there

281
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,519
It's very

282
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
very

283
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:08,639
Very small but it gives a space between these areas

284
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:11,455
That is why I'm doing that

285
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,855
Then also he can put default values which will be used during

286
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,647
Installation of the component

287
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:20,927
So if you have

288
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,231
Switches in your config

289
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,583
That you want to populate with default values should just add those values here

290
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,631
And then during the install

291
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,727
Those values will be added to the database and

292
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,543
Component builder puts all that in place for you

293
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,103
So this is where you add the config

294
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,383
Fields

295
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
And there is another Convention which is maybe

296
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
Not

297
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Is not

298
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:47,295
That

299
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
It's not that obvious

300
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
But

301
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,743
I added a convention that if you use a tab name

302
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
Which is exactly the same

303
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,583
As a

304
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,399
Front-end View

305
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Then

306
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
I will add

307
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
This field

308
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:11,615
to that front-end views menu

309
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
Now

310
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:18,527
If you can see it if you think about component sorry of Joomla's

311
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,295
Content

312
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,855
Manager manager

313
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,647
It does the same thing

314
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:30,303
In the global setting of your article manager you can set features for categories and for articles

315
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,143
But if you create a new article in a menu item

316
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
Then you can overwrite those you can say use global or you can overwrite them now this feature

317
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,103
Of using the same tab name

318
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,663
So let's look at this

319
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
The features name is

320
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Preacher

321
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Switch

322
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,855
Whether should be a table or a grid

323
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:56,671
Ok and we set the default 2

324
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
And we called it preachers plural

325
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
That's quite important

326
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,047
Now

327
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,095
Let's look at the front

328
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
Close this out

329
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,215
here Do I have a bunch of menus

330
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,311
I'm gonna go to a menu that I've already created called preachers

331
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:19,711
And then I'm also gonna go to this components backend

332
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:21,247
called preachers

333
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,135
So you see there is a list of items now all I did in the component Builder

334
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:29,439
Is I simply added

335
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
The name preacher as a tab name

336
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,583
That's all I did

337
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,375
And then the fields

338
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
So there is the list of the fields from there

339
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
to there

340
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:44,031
These are the fields you can see them here

341
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,103
These Fields I simply created in the field

342
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,127
Area

343
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,199
With field type so is basically some radio buttons

344
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,479
A drop down list

345
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
Another dropdown list and again some radio button

346
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Ok so these are the fields

347
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:01,951
And then in the view if you click on sermon distributor

348
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:06,047
You see those exact same Fields and it has the option of using

349
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
The global

350
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,423
Instead so there's used global or you can overwrite it

351
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:16,287
So you can decide ok this specific admin view I want to use grid and not the global

352
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,055
option

353
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
So that whole system

354
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
Of adding

355
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:27,295
This extra features to every item view of the front end

356
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,135
Is integrated simply by a convention

357
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:35,231
If the front end is called preachers which this case it is

358
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,607
As you can see there it's called preacher see I just selected a menu item called preachers

359
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,007
Now we haven't dealt with setting up your site views and all that so this might be

360
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,823
How did you get that item name right in everything

361
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
But

362
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,383
I'm trying to

363
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:58,271
Sketch a picture which we will revisit when we eventually get to this area

364
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:03,391
But just that you know from where it comes it's simply in the config

365
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
I added the files and used to convention of the actual

366
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,999
Front-end

367
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:11,071
Page that has a name called preachers

368
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,095
And

369
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:15,167
So there is as well for preacher which is single

370
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,983
So if I closed out select

371
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:25,151
sermon distributor and then select preacher

372
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,199
Which is another View

373
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:31,039
And then I clicked here you see all these switches

374
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
They also

375
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,111
Mapped in here

376
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,135
From there

377
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,927
All the way

378
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
to there

379
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:42,303
And they have some default values in there there there are there

380
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Fields

381
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:49,471
And in the back end of the component if I click on preacher

382
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,055
Here is the same Fields so you can set Global settings

383
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:56,639
And then you can overwrite them sorry in the menu itself

384
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Why not using Global

385
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
So that this whole feature

386
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Is possible

387
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:04,063
Through this config

388
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,111
Little tab sorry it looks

389
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Insignificant I suppose

390
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,047
And you might not expect it like I said it's not that obvious that it does this

391
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,607
But that is what it is doing

392
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:22,495
And so as you can see all of those certain areas I just mapped it in config

393
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:28,383
And because of the name of the tab let me stress that

394
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,943
Because of the name of the tab

395
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,807
The system knows oh so this is related to any front end menus as well

396
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,391
Therefore it will automatically create those front end

397
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
Things for you

398
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:44,511
Now to show you how it is done it's quite

399
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,535
Simple

400
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,631
Not that I want to teach you how

401
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,959
The Joomla API works but I want you to at least know

402
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,311
What is doing so I'm gonna go to the front of this component here it is

403
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:01,407
And I'm gonna open that view preachers

404
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:06,527
And you'd see in template there is a extra file called

405
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:08,063
Default XML

406
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
And then I'll open that default XML

407
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,439
Basically all component builder is doing

408
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,487
it is adding

409
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,791
The convention to this file

410
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,631
So if you're running into troubles and it's not working as you expected

411
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,191
This is the file in which you can come and look

412
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
To see what's happening

413
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,775
That is in the front end

414
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,567
In views

415
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,919
In the specific view that you have to it must be this view must be the

416
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
The tab name

417
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:36,991
And then

418
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:39,551
In that file called default XML

419
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,343
Obviously

420
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,879
This is important

421
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,951
Since we haven't dealt with adding site views

422
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
The site views here

423
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:54,143
I need to quickly touch on it so did you at least know

424
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,447
Something that relates to this

425
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:00,031
That is if you didn't click on add as a menu

426
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
You sets its to no

427
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
Then that file will not exist

428
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,247
Ok so that file only exist if this is set to yes

429
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
So setting it to yes

430
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:15,903
Tells component builder to build this default XML file

431
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:20,256
And setting the tabs to the same name as this view

432
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:23,072
Tells component builder to add those fields

433
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
To this

434
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,656
Few and make it so that

435
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,192
your user can then

436
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:28,960
Have

437
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
Unique

438
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,056
Implementation obviously

439
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
And this is important

440
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,384
It doesn't make use

441
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,408
Of

442
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,504
This information necessary inside of your site

443
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:42,784
View

444
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
You need to

445
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,136
Make use of this information in your site view

446
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,976
Now If you're a developer you would expect that right you would know

447
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,048
Oh yeah ok so inside of your

448
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:55,072
Component

449
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
You have

450
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,400
A place where you check

451
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
params header

452
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,080
Should it show then it shows it and it basically you getting it from the parameters

453
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:12,480
The parameters are set inside of the view.html.php

454
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:15,040
You see here we set the parameters

455
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:16,064
We get

456
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,464
We do on this app get parameters now this actually gets all the parameters in relation to this view

457
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:28,864
The gets that component parameters it gets the menu parameters and it automatically

458
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,400
If it has the

459
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
custom

460
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
So

461
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:35,520
I feel like I'm

462
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:39,872
maybe going Beyond the scope but if they've used Global

463
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:45,248
It will automatically fall back on what the set here which is excellent

464
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:47,296
So you're using the same name

465
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,576
Display

466
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:51,392
And display where is it

467
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
It's the same name

468
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,816
And so if you are using Global basically what parameters does

469
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
Is it getting this place parameter

470
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:04,960
The display field it's getting that parameter

471
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,520
And it first looks at the menus

472
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:13,152
Settings and that one is set to Global it automatically Falls back to the global settings

473
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:19,552
That is done by Joomla itself it's not really something I build it's just the way Joomla works which is excellent

474
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
And

475
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,880
That means that you immediately

476
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
By using params

477
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
And then doing a check-up

478
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,840
So remember now this value

479
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,888
Is inside of this params

480
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,192
And if I didn't go to the default View

481
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,544
And let's see where am I implementing some of that

482
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,104
Let's go to

483
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:51,296
Here the preacher display

484
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Ok

485
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:57,696
So the field name wasn't just display I'm sorry it was called preachers display

486
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
That's the

487
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
The field name

488
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,536
In the global

489
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
Configurations

490
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
So

491
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,120
You're not with me

492
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,656
It is what we

493
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,752
Used for this field

494
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,640
Switch preacher

495
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,664
Table grid

496
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
It's called preacher display

497
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:25,344
If I was to go and open this field in fact if you do that so if you see the whole picture

498
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,672
Switch preachers table grid let me just remember that

499
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,120
Ok here is the list of the switch preachers

500
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,192
Fields as you can see I'm in the fields

501
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:40,960
Tab

502
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
And I'll open that

503
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:43,264
Specific

504
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Field

505
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,616
And you'd see that the name

506
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,640
Of that

507
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
The name

508
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
Of this field is preachers

509
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,296
Underscore display

510
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:56,832
Now

511
00:24:57,088 --> 00:25:00,672
You need to make sure that none of the fields have the same name

512
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,232
That is quite important

513
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,536
What I mean by none of the fields I mean

514
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,608
This field must not be the same name is that field

515
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,704
Every field in this Global area must be unique

516
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,752
It should never overlap

517
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
So that is why I use the convention of preachers display so that I can also use preacher

518
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,456
Without the s display and I can use

519
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,248
Category

520
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:30,624
Underscore display in you see so that I have that site of convention of implementation

521
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:35,488
Is it all around as you develop think about conventions using sort of

522
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,816
Logical repetitive scalable concepts

523
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:42,144
And so this is one of them that I've done

524
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:45,216
And then I just added it here

525
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
It's that specific item

526
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,056
And then in the

527
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:55,456
Global area you go to preachers it is basically this view here

528
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,504
Sorry field

529
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,040
This field here

530
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
And in the code

531
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,112
On

532
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
I'm simply saying

533
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,696
If preacher = 1

534
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,000
Then show the table

535
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,280
If

536
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,864
Preacher display = 2 then show the grid

537
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:16,192
And if non is selected and show the list

538
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:19,008
Which is the three options if you look at the button

539
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,056
The button has Table grid list

540
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
And

541
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,360
So

542
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:30,016
I'm not asking does the global have this or that none of that I'm just calling the field directly

543
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:35,136
Because the way that Joomla gets that initial data like I showed you here

544
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:39,744
Is they sort that out for you and that's quite nice

545
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,560
And I've obviously test it and made sure that my

546
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:46,144
My explanation is the truth

547
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,472
And so goes with the colours you can see here I

548
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,288
I again just do params get colors

549
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,104
But this is actually knowledge that you would have

550
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
If you have developed a component for Joomla

551
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:00,992
You would know about these tricks I suppose

552
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,136
And I'm just showing to you how of component Build It makes it easy to implement these kind of things

553
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,696
which otherwise would take so much time

554
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
to

555
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,864
Write this up and then make sure it's exactly the same inside of the XML folder menu and so forth

556
00:27:17,376 --> 00:27:19,424
So component builder does all of that

557
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
Out of this config file

558
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
Simply with a

559
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,824
Convention that relates to the actual front-end

560
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
And that is as simple as that

561
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Ok so

562
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,712
I think we have covered that

563
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,248
Thoroughly enough

564
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:34,784
And

565
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:37,088
That will be all for this tutorial

566
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,904
I will continue looking at more

567
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,208
Concepts of the component

568
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
And it's features

569
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,584
Possibly it might be ideal for us to

570
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Stop here

571
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,400
With the component

572
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:53,472
And go look at setting up a custom admin View

573
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Or setting up a site view

574
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,128
And yet I'm thinking you know if we go that route

575
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,176
It's gonna take us on a very long

576
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,456
Road so

577
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,040
The ideal with me let me sort of

578
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,624
Dealt with some of this component features First

579
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:12,160
And finish that

580
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,208
And then as soon as we've finished it

581
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,280
We'll jump into the custom very

582
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:23,424
Nice area of your front-end development and custom admin development

583
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:28,544
And then we will obviously be relating back to what we have discussed here

584
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
As we go

585
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,152
So I've now looked at the setting tab

586
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:36,480
And try to cover as much of this area as I can

587
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,808
I didn't talk much about mySQL  tweak

588
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
This is a very advanced feature

589
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
And

590
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,256
You can know that what it really does if we have dummy data

591
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
You're able to

592
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,584
Exclude them

593
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,168
Through this area so that if you have different versions

594
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:59,008
You will through this MySQL tweak

595
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,824
Be able to exclude certain information

596
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:07,712
Which I realise it's a little bit advance and so for most cases people will just not use this

597
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:12,064
It's only when you start having multiple versions of the same extension

598
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
And you selling them at different pricing and

599
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:16,928
Want to be able to

600
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:21,024
From Within component builder just export the different versions

601
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
Then you start using this feature

602
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,096
And

603
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:29,728
I think we possibly deal with it with when we start looking at more advanced implementations

604
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,288
Ok thank you for watching

605
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
We'll start in the next run with scripts
