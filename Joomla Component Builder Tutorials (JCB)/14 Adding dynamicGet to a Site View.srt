1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Hi now that we have the dynamic Get in place let's add that to a

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Site view and look at the initial implementation we will go to site view

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
And then click on new but since we already have

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
That you created we just gonna open it called preacher

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
You would see there on the right-hand there are 3 Fields that you can

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Populate with your Dynamic get methods the first one is where you would add

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
All the custom Dynamic gets and there you can add multiple custom dynamic gets

8
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
The second one is where you add your main Dynamic get as we explained in the dynamic get

9
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
Tutorial you can add 1 Main get method per

10
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
View or site view since it's going to be build in the model

11
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Either as a get item or a get items it is all depending on the

12
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,984
Main get weather it's gonna be a list or just an

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,544
An individual item

14
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:20,896
Yet you can include Dynamic Gets

15
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
Custom Dynamic gets as many as you like

16
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,064
You also have this data available in your view

17
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:32,672
So these two first fields are used to load

18
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
The Dynamic get to the view

19
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,768
The third one

20
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:42,144
Is used to display the possible way that you might want to implement

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
The code of a specific

22
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
Dynamic get option

23
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:48,032
You'll see that

24
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,824
This one only displays

25
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:54,176
Possible main Gets this one only this place customer gets

26
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
Where is this displays both

27
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,832
The custom and the main kind of Gets

28
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,112
Now

29
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
If you select a

30
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:05,184


31
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,768
 let's go to

32
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,888
One of these Main

33
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,680
Gets

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,704
Sermon

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,240
This one here

36
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,336
You see that it shows us

37
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,616
A list

38
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:27,456
Print out of the possible ways that you might

39
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,528
Use the result set

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:37,696
Obviously each of these you can copy by clicking in it and then clicking on

41
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,232
either right click

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,512
And

43
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,352
Copy or you could click on ctrl V

44
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,400


45
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168


46
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:49,984
ctrl C and command C

47
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,056
 to copy respectively the content

48
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:59,200
Sometimes you might only want to use part of it and not the echo statement included

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,832
Then you can pick from the area where you want to copy and then before letting go

50
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:08,416
Click on control C or command C in a Mac

51
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
to insure

52
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,768
 you only grab that section of the text

53
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,864
Once you let it go it will select the whole block and then

54
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Obviously if you copy it you will copy everything

55
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
As you can see

56
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
We then use 

57
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,408
This code in our default View

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
To  display the data

59
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,064
In a PHP

60
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Fashion

61
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,280
You can also get the the customer get here let me show you that one preacher

62
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:47,840
Like you see it says that that

63
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,656
Value is gonna be in this preacher

64
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:55,520
And if we look here at the top that is what we are checking for here

65
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,336
Make sure that you have a Preacher

66
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:00,384
And then this block

67
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,480
Basically deals with displaying the data related to that

68
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,272
Information

69
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,064
This one here

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:14,464
Checks whether the main items are on the on the page and now the main items as you can see

71
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,536
Is sermons preacher ID get list

72
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,839
So if I go down to that

73
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
sermon preacher

74
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655
I get List

75
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:26,751
You see that again it shows me that the values are in items

76
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
And it's in array

77
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:32,639
So I can loop through it and target the the object values

78
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
And that's what's being done here

79
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:38,015
We first checking whether it's

80
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
On the page the values

81
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,087
Then

82
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:43,135
If we see that it is here

83
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
We use make use of templates

84
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,487
to

85
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535
to display the various

86
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,071
Layouts

87
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
And

88
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:57,727
I will explain in a next tutorial  how to use templates in layouts inside

89
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
Of your site View

90
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:04,127
But this is just quickly showing you how to connect

91
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,175
A dynamic get

92
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711
Structure or

93
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,271
Methods to your view

94
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:15,903
And then how to make use of the data that are being passed through to the view

95
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,487
So this data structures here on the right in red

96
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,839
Is basically the the data structure that you can expect

97
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,471
From each one of these so if I was to take number sermons

98
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:32,031
As the

99
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:33,823
Method that I want to see

100
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,919
Then it shows me that

101
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:42,527
That's possibly the way that it will be packed into the data set

102
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,415
So it'll be found in this number sermons is how

103
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:50,719
Now that could change

104
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,535
Depending on your custome

105
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,071
implementation

106
00:05:55,327 --> 00:06:01,471
In your components custom coding areas you might move this data from that

107
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Position to something else

108
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,639
But the reality is this at least gives you how it would have looked without you

109
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
You know I'm leaving the

110
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,711
The normal Path

111
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,783
So this is just

112
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Proposing the dataset structure

113
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:21,951
Which ideally would be that you would take this value here

114
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
And

115
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:28,095
Maybe do this in the code

116
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
Do a var_dump

117
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
And then exit

118
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,615
And then

119
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:45,247
Basically do a build and go look at this view to see exactly the structure

120
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
If  you are finding that this structure that we've shown isn't working exactly as we expected

121
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,231
Often this helps us

122
00:06:55,487 --> 00:07:01,631
To sort a map the array and see where What value is found same goes with any of the others

123
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:05,727
You can just grab that area

124
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,031
That you want to peek into

125
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Put it in var_dump

126
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:13,919
Do a build go look at this page

127
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,223
In the in the front of your site

128
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,039
And you can see exactly the structure of this

129
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,575
This object here

130
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,975
Whether it is an array with objects or whatever

131
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:32,607
Is placed inside of this value set through the dynamic get method

132
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,423
Now I just want to quickly

133
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,703
Peek at the

134
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,335
Way that these methods are actually becoming available in your view

135
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
by going to the code

136
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,663
And just looking at

137
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,735
Some of the implementations that we've done

138
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
Ok

139
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
As you can see we've gone to the front of the site

140
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,183
sermon distributor

141
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Models

142
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,255
And we've opened

143
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,559
The preacher model

144
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:05,119
Use the preacher model

145
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:06,655
And

146
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
As you scroll down you see that there's a get list query

147
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,847
This get list query gets sermon as the a

148
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,895
Table

149
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
And then

150
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:21,759
Series as the C table preacher is the D

151
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
and Categories is the

152
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Sorry

153
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,391
C D B

154
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
Is the B table

155
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,999
And then it looks for a value

156
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
in ID

157
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
And then

158
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
Sets it equal to preacher

159
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,703
And in sure that it

160
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
The person has access level to the item

161
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,055
That's published

162
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
And then returns it

163
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,663
So that is the

164
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,431
Get

165
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:52,991
List query in the model

166
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:55,807
Have you go back to our

167
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:00,415
interface you see that we have

168
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:02,207
sermon preacher

169
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,791
ID get list as the main

170
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:09,375
And I've opened that Dynamic get here

171
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,447
let me just see where is it

172
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,983


173
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
And you can see that

174
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,663
Sermon is set as A the main table

175
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,807
And if you open here you see that series is set as C the only looking for those values

176
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,135
Preacher said is d only those values

177
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Statistics

178
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,695
E

179
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,487
But it's a list

180
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,791
it is Multiple

181
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
These that are single are part of the list query where is the multiple of it will have its own object sorry it's

182
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:45,471
Method

183
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,519
we will Look at that quickly

184
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
And then

185
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,895
We see in the DB table

186
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,455
That we have category a single

187
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,479
 as B

188
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,759
Only those values

189
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
So going back to the code

190
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,183
This is the get list query in the get item

191
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
After we have received the items

192
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,047
We look through them

193
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,119
And then in this function here get

194
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
Sermon statistics and then a

195
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,239
A generated string

196
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,311
Randomly generated string to ensure

197
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,383
No conflicting with other methods on the page

198
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,943
Puts the values in 

199
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
ID sermons statistics e

200
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
So that's where the values of place

201
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:36,159
And then basically we have a custom

202
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:41,535
Method here like be shown in the dynamic get you can add custom methods

203
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,607
And then returns the items to the page

204
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
And in the page

205
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:47,935
You have a

206
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,751
A file

207
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
That is called

208
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:53,823
View

209
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103


210
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:58,687
Sorry view HTML dot. PHP

211
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:00,479
If you open this 

212
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,831
File you see that there is a get items

213
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,951
Method being used to place the items in items

214
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
And so

215
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:15,071
At the moment we are actually in the view at this stage

216
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:18,143
And that means you can access

217
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
This set of values

218
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Inside of that

219
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,567
Class field

220
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:29,407
And so if we go back to our

221
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,943
Component Builder

222
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,807
You would see if we were to select

223
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:39,135
That method

224
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
There is the items

225
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,351
Corresponding to our code

226
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:54,239
And so we know that the ID in the asset ID in all these are in there if you scroll down

227
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:58,591
You see that there is it sermons is too sticky see it there

228
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:01,151
So that means

229
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,455
In the array there is a

230
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
key value

231
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,807
Which has another set of array values in it

232
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,879
So you can target these data sets

233
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
By corresponding

234
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,439


235
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
pointing

236
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,767
Values

237
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
So that is just looking at the main get

238
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Now if we were to look at

239
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,519
The other custom get

240
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,311
That is been added

241
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,615
We'll see that here's preacher

242
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
Which is a custom get

243
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
or custom method

244
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
That is been added

245
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
And

246
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,343
It also has its set of

247
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:47,487
Values and it's database structure and remember we said that we want it to be

248
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:50,047
Link to the preachers ID

249
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,607
So can I check for the ID

250
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
And then

251
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,935
Set it to ID

252
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,983
And returns the result

253
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
Same goes with the number of downloads

254
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,359
It's also custom method

255
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,383
That said

256
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,711
To this view because of the custom get that was added

257
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,551
And here is the number sermons

258
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:16,159
And we go back to our view dot HTML dot php file

259
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:20,255
We see that those values are respectively being added

260
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,303
To preacher

261
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,375
Number downloads and number sermons

262
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:31,775
And you can actually use these values in the view by targeting with this number

263
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:32,799
Sermons

264
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,359
Now the view itself is

265
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:37,919
As you should know inside of

266
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
the template folder

267
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
Under the views preacher

268
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
And this Main

269
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:50,463
View as we call it all the default view is where that code that we on the page that we looking at right now

270
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Being placed

271
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:57,375
All these others are the templates that are extending the site View

272
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:04,287
And they possibly are extended through layouts that are available in the layouts folder

273
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:05,823
So

274
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,151
We are we are now just looking at adding

275
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:13,759
The custom get methods to the page in our next to tutorial

276
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,343
we are going in depth about adding templates to your

277
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,367
Custom

278
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,671
 Site View

279
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
And making use of these data sets

280
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:25,279
So

281
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:30,655
That is how you link them your first create the custom get then you come here you link these

282
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,447
So these are the linking

283
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,335
Fields and these are just so that you can see the code snippets are making use of these fields

284
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,615
Respectively

285
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
And

286
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
That is custom

287
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:45,247
Gets added to site view

288
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,527
Thank you for watching
