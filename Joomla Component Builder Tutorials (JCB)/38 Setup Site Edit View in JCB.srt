00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:04,352
Hi I'd like to quickly give you a tutorial

2
00:00:04,608 --> 00:00:05,888
On how to

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,960
Basically add

4
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:10,752
An admin View

5
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,544
To the front end of your site

6
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:13,824
So

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,640
There can be editing and submission

8
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Of the front end

9
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:21,248
of this specific admin View now

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,040
Illustrate this

11
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:27,392
I'm gonna use the public version of JCB

12
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,952
And it has this demo

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,816
Version in it so basically first I'll just compile it

14
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:37,888
and install it to the local Joomla website

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,960
So we can see what happens

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
And then install it

17
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:52,224
And then basically open it

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,392
So here we have the

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,440
The demo version

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:06,816
That is publicly available and it basically has a admin view called "Looks"

21
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:10,144
So if you go to the list you of the admin View

22
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,728
I call Looks you see there is none, we will create new

23
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,800
And then

24
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,616
There is basically a description box

25
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
A more item where you can click

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
And see some

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,296
Custom Fields and fields

28
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
Being built sorry email mobile birth

29
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,160
Image website

30
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,768
And your normal publish and permission structure for the view

31
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,048
And the name field

32
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:42,656
Now that's basically what I referred to as the admin View

33
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,312
It's this combination of fields working together in one View

34
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,176
Now what I will show you is how to add this

35
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:59,040
Editing area, basically the these three tabs

36
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,088
To the front end of your site

37
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,904
So that it will function like a form

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:10,304
Now who you would allowed to access the form will depend upon the permissions structure

39
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,120
You see the permission structure

40
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:13,888
Is what

41
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,704
Actually controls who can edit

42
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
And who can add

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,080
Items to a specific admin View

44
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:26,944
So currently as you can see your public cannot actually edit this

45
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,992
If we created an item

46
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:32,320
They cannot edit it so there's an item level on permissions

47
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,368
and if I Close out of this

48
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
Then you'll see here in options there is also a global control on

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
Permissions

50
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,632
So the global control of permissions

51
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:49,472
Is also if you want public to be able to submit

52
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,544
To to this form you need to

53
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,640
Allow them to be able to create so you would say allow

54
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:59,968
And now the public is allowed to create

55
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:00,992
And

56
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
You see that usually

57
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:06,112
Most components has more than one View

58
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,440
This one only has one it's called look

59
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,256
So you'll also have to

60
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:13,536
Over here

61
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Say allow

62
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:19,168
And if you want them to edit existing submissions

63
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,264
Then there is the edit State edit own created by

64
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,640
All these things in the Global Spec as well as in the local edit of The View

65
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
So there is basically two switches here one is a Global switch and one that is

66
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
specifically focusing on the view so if you cannot access the view on the front end

67
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
After we've created it it is actually would need to come back to to this area and

68
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
And sort out the permissions for the specific group

69
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,776
Who should have access to the specific View

70
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,056
On a front end

71
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:03,968
so this permissional structure is quite intense and

72
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:10,368
Extendable so that you can target specific groups with specific permissions and so forth

73
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,648
For every View

74
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:14,464
The JCB bolts in the admin

75
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
As well as site

76
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
Ok let me cancel out of here

77
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,327
I'm not gonna

78
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,375
Make any further changes here

79
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:27,775
So we basically in the demo component now I'm gonna go back to JCB and basically

80
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:34,175
I'm gonna flip one switch and then JCB will actually develop or write the code

81
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,991
For the site end of this component

82
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,807
So I'm going back to JCB

83
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,599
Going to components

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:45,951
And I'm opening the component

85
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:57,727
And now in the component there is an area called settings where obviously all your admin views

86
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:02,079
Are linked right so I'm gonna open that

87
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,895
Are usually there is a little bug in

88
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:08,479
Joomla which if you open it the first time it doesn't

89
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
Reflect the original setting

90
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,183
So I usually just open it cancel it and then open it again and you'll see that the original setting is

91
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:17,951
Is back

92
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
And

93
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,767
You see here that

94
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,815
Edit create site view

95
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,375
Must be set to "Yes"

96
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
If it is set to "Yes" then it means that it's gonna create a site view

97
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
Off this look as so that you can edit it on the site end and not only in the admin

98
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:39,967
Area

99
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,527
And it also means create items

100
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
So I'm just gonna save this

101
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,879
And then also save and close

102
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,303
And then go back to compiler

103
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:56,607
Compile

104
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:57,631
Demo

105
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,167
I see that off

106
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,191
Go

107
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,799
Install it

108
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:07,359
Now let's go look at the code

109
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:13,503
So looking at the demo websites folder structure we are going to components

110
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:19,391
And then we'll see that there is a com underscore demo folder

111
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:24,511
And we will see there is the modules as well as the controllers

112
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:26,303
As well as the views

113
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,887
So there is basically

114
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,703
This is the view that was dynamically generated

115
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,983
By

116
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:36,799
JCB review called look

117
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:41,151
And then the model also called look

118
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:42,943
And the controller

119
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,479
Are you can open that

120
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,063
To actually see what was the code that was written

121
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
And so as you can see it's basically looks very similar to the admin area except that it's been slightly

122
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,535
Modified

123
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,071
For your front end

124
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,119
And it's requirements

125
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
As you can see we were adding

126
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:07,263
Some CSS classes and JavaScript

127
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,287
From the back end

128
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,847
And

129
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Then

130
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:14,943
Here is the model

131
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:19,551
Basically get item get form

132
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,879
And then here is the controller

133
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Ok so we

134
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:28,767
just showing at the code just basically what was created

135
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,303
Now

136
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,607
The fact that this was created

137
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
Doesn't mean that there is actually Now set of links

138
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:42,335
That you can click and edit the forms which was submitted

139
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,919
or that there is a link to create any

140
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,783
So these these things is what you need to do manually

141
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:52,319
Now so

142
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:54,111
Let's show you some of that

143
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,975
as you can see there is two views here

144
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
In called on the site views

145
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:04,607
And one is called looks and other one is called looking

146
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
As you can remember the one we looked at here

147
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:13,823
Which I said was automatically generate is called look so that one isn't actually showing because it was just

148
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:17,663
a tick box that created this whole view model and controller

149
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
So you don't need to build

150
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,991
The look view again

151
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,807
But you need to get links to it

152
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
Ok so

153
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,671
In looks we are using a dynamic get

154
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:33,279
And in looking as well so let's let's go to the dynamic get page

155
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:43,007
So there is one called looks and looking so good let's go to the looks dynamic get

156
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:52,991
So as you can see here is the dynamic get for the look

157
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,319
Looks and it got a custom script area

158
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:02,463
Were basically we're asking whether the items are set whether there are items and then we looping through them

159
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:06,815
And during the looping process we basically determine

160
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
By this ScanDo script here

161
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,471
You see in the helper class there's a get action function

162
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,055
The get action function asks whether look item

163
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:21,663
With the current user has the edit option

164
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,735
To the specific look item

165
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:28,831
And if it does it actually in this little script here

166
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:32,159
It builds an edit look button

167
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:36,255
And dynamically adds that to the edit link

168
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:39,327
Which is coupled to the item

169
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,887
And then just continues on

170
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:48,031
So it basically dynamically generates the button for edit here in the dynamic get

171
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:53,151
Are you could have done that anywhere I just decided to do it here because then it actually

172
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:56,223
gets added to the model which is more

173
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:58,527
Where your logic

174
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
For lots of your data structure should be placed

175
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:06,719
And ok so now if you go back to this to the views the site views

176
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,047
And we open the looks site view

177
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:18,239
You see that we got the main get set as looks

178
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,799
And here

179
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,359
If you scroll down

180
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,151
Well basically

181
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:29,247
In this area here we are looping

182
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:31,295
Through the look items

183
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,343
And

184
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:36,159
Echoing the edit link

185
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
After the description

186
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,887
And that means now the link that we built here in the dynamic Get

187
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,167
Which is the button

188
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:54,335
Will either be empty and therefore show nothing if the user doesn't have the permission to edit it

189
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:57,663
Or it will actually show a button

190
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
You also see

191
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,415
There is currently as I look at this I haven't actually added

192
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,207
A a link

193
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,999
For creating new

194
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,815
Looks and

195
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,887
The same would be required to do that

196
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
So

197
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:23,263
You could use the same button script just copy that

198
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,311
And

199
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
Here at the head before the table

200
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:29,663
You could

201
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:33,247
Add a button to create new looks

202
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Now

203
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,343
All you would need to change is basically

204
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,879
This link here

205
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
That it will have an ID to zero

206
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:46,303
And then it will actually create a new

207
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,071
Look

208
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
So that's a quick tutorial

209
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
On how to add

210
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,471
An editable

211
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Admin View to the site

212
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
End of your component

213
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
And then link it into your side view so that you can basically click on a button and edit

214
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,015
A specific ID View

215
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,831
Or create more

216
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,719
And then control that with this get action helper class

217
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Method

218
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Which gives you

219
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,351
Basically whether it can be edited

220
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:23,679
You can go look at this helper class in the code

221
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:25,983
So let me just quickly open that for you

222
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
So here in the code

223
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,311
And helpers

224
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
We open

225
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,151
Demo PHP

226
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,711
And we scroll down

227
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
Until we get the method called

228
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:40,831
getaction

229
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Where is it now

230
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Ok here it is

231
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
getaction

232
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:56,703
Around 540 depends on how much the customer scripting there is been added

233
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,239
And

234
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
You can go through this logic

235
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,639
To see that we are dealing with a number of

236
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
Concepts and trying to determine the permissional

237
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,015
To edit own

238
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:12,575
And to create and so forth

239
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,623
And it all gets stored

240
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,671
And given back to you

241
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
Basically in the result set

242
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
Ok

243
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
So

244
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:26,399
You could also just echo out the result var dump or something

245
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
In the look

246
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
to see

247
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:34,335
Exactly what is the result that you get from that structure

248
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,871
So

249
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,431
If we go back to

250
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:42,015
The looks here View

251
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,831
Let's just open that model

252
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:48,159
You see that the custom scripting we looked at

253
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:50,463
Basically gets added here

254
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,743
From JCB

255
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
That custom scripting that creates the button

256
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:56,095
So you could come in here

257
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,655
And you can just add a var

258
00:13:59,167 --> 00:13:59,679
Dump

259
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
Exit and

260
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,055
Take this can do

261
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
And

262
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,943
Login as any kind of user on the site

263
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
And then

264
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:15,807
When you basically load the page it should show you

265
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
The can do

266
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,367
List

267
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
Of that specific User Group

268
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:26,047
Also keep in mind that here's the authorities setting

269
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,887
That is applicable to the looks site View

270
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,215
And it also controlled in the permission structure

271
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,103
So there's a lot of permissions automatically being added to components build in JCB

272
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,919
And you need to always keep that in mind

273
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:48,319
It might look like things don't work while it actually works very well you just Haven't kept in mind that there is a permissional

274
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Structure

275
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,695
And that you need to adapt that permissional on structure as it's fitting to your project

276
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
Ok well thank you for watching

277
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Hope this helps
