00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Hi we've just finished with admin views and we now would like to start

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
looking at advanced field types now there are a few advanced field types and the one there

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
Is most advanced is the one called custom field type so I'm gonna sort this

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Here by custom Fields it's that one

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
And you see it in This moment we have quite a few custom fields in place

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
Now let's look at two of those one is the local file

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
List the other one is let's do a sermon sermon one but let's first look

8
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
Look at the local file list you'd see that basically from there

9
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
All the way down to there is simply PHP

10
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
So I'm creating a view which is most basically

11
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
Taking information if you know PHP from the global settings of your component so there

12
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
need to be a field with a name local folder in your Global settings will still look at how to set up

13
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Global settings when we get to component and if it hasn't got a

14
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Setting it falls back onto the image which is in the Jpath root

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
For your component this will be replaced with your component name and it puts it into local folder

16
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
And then I just start the options and

17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
The options array which you gonna return and the first thing I add to it is a Please select a

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
File add files oh yes if there isn't files

19
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
It will say please add files to and it will give the local folder name if

20
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
There is files we gonna update those then over here so first we bring in

21
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
the File system classes from Joomla then we

22
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
Basically check whether that folder exists and if it doesn't exist we create it

23
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
That's just in the field type now once it's created and if it exists it obviously

24
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
skips this doesn't go in there and it just starts by grabbing all the files

25
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
And from that folder and place it into files and then start something array

26
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Where it Loops the files and put it into options and

27
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
By doing that we are basically let me just check here and make sure

28
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
we're adding the file name and the file name

29
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
To our options array and then returning the options array so you can add your own custom PHP

30
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
Scripting in the when you extend a listview so the list sorry list field were

31
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
Extending list field so it's just gonna be a drop down list of all the files in that specific folder

32
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
either images or the folder that it was set globally in local folder OK so that's your setting up

33
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
a folder now there is a field type

34
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
Called filelist I think Ya there it is the reason why I didn't

35
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
Use filelist is because finalist has a static directory to where

36
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
You need to add the files so that you can view them and we wanted

37
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
To have it be able to rename the file folder sorry the folder

38
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
For the files for the media do anything and then have it update itself automatically so that's why we then created a

39
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
Custom field where we extended the list type and let me just refreshed this

40
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
to get that Detail back so we chose a custom field and then

41
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
We just extend the list type and we don't want it to have a

42
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
You button because you it won't work you will just break and we don't want them to select

43
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
Multiple oh yes we are allowing them to select multiple now since we are using multiple

44
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
We need to go back and make sure that we are storing it as a Json so the Json is when have

45
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Multiple or erase any kind of arrays in a value you need to store it as a Json

46
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
And the component builder itself will check if it is a multiple

47
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,799
Selection is true it will automatically store it in a Json object even if you forgot to select this

48
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
So we have got some things in place to sort of ensure that it's system

49
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Behaves as expected Ok let me see that's just quick view on

50
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
Doing a local file custom field as a local file now

51
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
Which I'm sure you all if you've been waiting for is let's look at how

52
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
How to create a sermon preacher custom field so basically it's a Preacher custom field

53
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
So what is this field gonna do it's gonna show a list of preachers

54
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:45,599
But is gonna basically display the preachers that are set up in the preacher listview ok so let's

55
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,999
Open that so let's see the convention

56
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:58,399
Is that you would call that type preachers that's the listview name

57
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:04,799
But you'd called the name you would use the same as the editing

58
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:11,199
Name which is preacher without the s so if you go back to your admin views you would

59
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
Use this name as the name of the field but you would use that name as the type

60
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:23,999
You see because you now creating a custom type and the logic behind it is it it's gonna show

61
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:30,399
A list of preachers but you gonna select just one preacher ok so that's just the logic the label

62
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:36,799
You can really put whatever you like whatever is descriptive enough for your user to understand

63
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:43,199
And then there's a place for adding a description then here we are set

64
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:49,599
Multiple to false we want them to only be able to select one preacher at a time

65
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,999
default zero these are all basically left to their default values and

66
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:02,399
Extending list is the most common custom field that we have if you wanna

67
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:08,799
Receive a list of custom Fields that is available you can go up here to extend and you see that list

68
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:15,199
Radio and check boxes are available I think I should update that too also say users

69
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:21,599
User is also a user option to extend users

70
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
If you want to see if we are what is available then look at that name

71
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:34,399
Jform field and go to component builder go to the

72
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:40,799
Back end of component builder so that would be administrator components component builder

73
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:47,199
Then go to compiler that's a folder then go to Joomla 3

74
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:53,599
Which is the current version we are targeting and then search for that

75
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:59,999
Jform there's it is Jform so

76
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:06,399
Ones that are available to extend let's see

77
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:12,799
it's the user Jform field user you must it must Jform field

78
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:19,199
So JForm field user Jform field radio Jform field list

79
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Jform field checkboxes this also means if there is a form field you

80
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:31,999
Want to extend that doesn't exist already in our advanced

81
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
Seminar will show you how to add your own form Fields here there is basically two places

82
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
you need to Change I wish I could tell you now one of them would be to add the field and update it accordingly

83
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:51,199
And the other one would be to add it in a few places in the code

84
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:57,599
And also in a Jason file called settings there so those are

85
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,999
Some of the things we will deal with in advanced adaptation of component Builder

86
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:10,399
We will still set up that series very soon it's not finished yet though ok

87
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
Getting back to extending a listview sorry listfield you Simply

88
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:23,199
There list ok then there's also a few

89
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:29,599
conventions one of them being that if you are gonna be targeting like this

90
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:35,999
Example we are targeting the preachers you will be using the preacher

91
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:42,399
Table as the table that is being targeted so the question to ask

92
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:48,799
Is where is the data gonna be found that is the table

93
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:55,199
That needs to be added in which component is it gonna be found and that is what need to be added by

94
00:09:55,455 --> 00:10:01,599
component now the reason why we have this hash hash hash component here

95
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
Because it's a placeholder which component builder will replace with the components code name

96
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:14,399
Once it's built it's a It's a feature we add it because some times

97
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:20,799
We want to rename components and if you had statically added

98
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
The actual component name there then you have to and every field go and update that name and in every

99
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:33,599
view go and update that name and you know every where were you actually statically the added the component's name

100
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:39,999
You will need to update it but to explain to you exactly what the system

101
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:46,399
Is doing I can go to components open sermon distributor

102
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
And then take the name a in code like that copy

103
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:59,199
And see that it's under underscore C if it was an uppercase

104
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:05,599
sorry not Underscore lowercase if it was a uppercase like that it mean

105
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,999
It would mean that you have to place this  the component

106
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:18,399
Name as well with an uppercase so you would do just a s lowercase

107
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,799
so that is actually what the system is doing it actually is

108
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:31,199
Just replacing these these Place holders with the with the actual component name on

109
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,599
Fly so using the placeholders basically saves you time in the long run

110
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:43,999
Prompt making changes everywhere if you make a change to components name

111
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:50,399
Which is quite normal to do very often you start with the component in his think of calling it something

112
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,799
and later Realized that name is actually been used in the Joomla repository and you need to choose another

113
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:03,199
And to do that is gonna affect the whole component and so we added this

114
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:09,599
Placeholder structure which should make a data less painful at least anywhere

115
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:15,999
in all the code custom coding that you're adding and you need to use the components name

116
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
You can simply use this hash tag format of replacement

117
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:28,799
In some areas you would need to use brackets like that

118
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:35,199
But most of the time it will work either way the best

119
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:41,599
Measure to to ensure is to try it with a hash's is first and

120
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:47,999
If you go into the code and you see it didn't replace it then you know it's the angle brackets that needs to

121
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:54,399
be used anyway so in this case we are using these hash hash signs

122
00:12:54,655 --> 00:13:00,799
symbols sorry characters and then the view again that is this

123
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
Single variable of the view so if we were to close this and go to the view

124
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:13,599
Which would be then preacher or lowercase

125
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
Is what you would be adding here make sure that it's always lowercase

126
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:26,399
And then the listview or the views plural would be

127
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:32,799
The add value there or lowercase as well and then the value field

128
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:39,199
Is the field that the user will see so that is what is visible

129
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:45,599
in the UI user interface the key field is the

130
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999
Value that will be stored in the database now these field relate to this table so in

131
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
Inside the table what field do you want the user to see now that would be the name of the preacher

132
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:04,799
And inside the table What field would you want to store

133
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:11,199
In the other database because we are looking into preacher but we gonna store it

134
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
Wherever this field is being used right so that would be the ID and

135
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:23,999
The column name in that data base of that view where this field will be used will be called

136
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:30,399
Preacher so to show that to you in the database itself can open it there

137
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:36,799
Scroll down to sermon distributor open sermons

138
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
click on structure and here in the back end

139
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:49,599
let's close this go to

140
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:55,999
Sermons new

141
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,399
And we will see that there is a place for preacher

142
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:08,799
If I was to look with firebug for it we'll see that it is basically

143
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:15,199
The name is preacher and remember we spoke about this J4_  as the ID

144
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
But it's actually Simply the preacher field which is being stored directly in

145
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:27,999
In the database in the preacher

146
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:34,399
Column of the table and it's stored as integer 11 and that

147
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,799
It was set up here right integer 11 and we say that it is a key so we can Target it

148
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:47,199
So here at the bottom if we look at in indexes we'll see that it

149
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:53,599
Has actually added it is a key and we go ok so that

150
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:59,999
All is done right here in the database structure and then in this area

151
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,399
Now again in this part which you can add your own custom PHP

152
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:12,799
The fact that I'm using 19 18 17 it's just sort of creating

153
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:19,199
Line breaks and spacing and tabs for me dynamically I could have placed them

154
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:25,599
All just under PHP one with without this

155
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:31,999
Quotation marks you know

156
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:38,399
Wrapping around them all like we just did with the  file folder list View

157
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:44,799
Just a note inside of this code you cannot

158
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:51,199
These quotation marks you need to

159
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Use single quotes unfortunately at this stage it is not able to

160
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:03,999
accommodate you even if you try to do an Escape it will not behave as it's as you might expect

161
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
So my apologies for that at this stage you can only do single

162
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,799
Quotes between these two quotations...double quotes

163
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
Ok so that is adding a custom field which is a little bit more advanced

164
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:29,599
If you know PHP you will know exactly what's happening here again these Place holders

165
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
reflect back to these values here so basically A dot  ID will be written there

166
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,399
and the Text value which is the field value is gonna be called a dot name

167
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:48,799
Name and then ID and code text this code

168
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:55,199
Is build-up by the view that we are in and the text so this would read

169
00:17:55,455 --> 00:18:01,599
Preacher sorry sermon preacher in in in the code and in fact

170
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,999
I can go show you how it looks when it builds it it's quickly look at that

171
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,399
So the show you where it starts let's open that

172
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
Field list so that is what it starts with basically it replaces this place holder

173
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:27,199
With your code ok and it replaces all these features

174
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,479
Up here as well

175
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,527
And updates that and

176
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,319
So every where you see these things

177
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,855
It's gonna be updated through component builder

178
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:39,999
And obviously everything up here will be replaced with your licensing tags

179
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,583
.

180
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Then now let's look at the

181
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
Finished product

182
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
Sermon

183
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,287
it's placed on the modules field

184
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,847
and there it is preachers

185
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Open it

186
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
You see that it added preacher there

187
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
And in the input

188
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
Add it and it also shows you

189
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,831
Where if you had trip that switch like we have explained

190
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,367
to show the line numbers in your component

191
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
It shows you in what file

192
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,999
These files

193
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
are found

194
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,559
Under

195
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
The

196
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:18,655
You go to component builder

197
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
under helper's

198
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
Compiler

199
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,031
there are these files that is

200
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,079
Being used to compile your component

201
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
.

202
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,479
I'll possibly when we go to the advanced section I'll go much more in-depth

203
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:33,759
in Regards to

204
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:35,295
These files

205
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:39,647
Now we just trying to get across how to build a component

206
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Not to extend

207
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Builder itself as yet

208
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:48,351
But at least here you can see where in the code it is actually building this

209
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
and compiling this

210
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
and Putting it together

211
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
And

212
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:54,239
Remember we talked about

213
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,031
It's it's

214
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,079
Getting

215
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,359
The structure let's

216
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Go down

217
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,407
this is used for

218
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
the button

219
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,015
This is to generate a new button

220
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,551
when you

221
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
Can click on new

222
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
Basically that is the

223
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,903
Button there ....this area

224
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,255
from there to There is generating the button

225
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,375
This is what controls whether the button should show up or whether it shouldn't then

226
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,935
And even if it is to be set at all

227
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,031
Ok so this is basically what generates the button...this area

228
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
This area here the get options

229
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:34,687
You see we said that it will show the name

230
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,223
And it will show ID

231
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
And so

232
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,295
Go back to our

233
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
Structure here

234
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,415
It basically we dynamically replaces these with those

235
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
The reason for it is it's actually done a few times

236
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,863
And I felt like ok let's let's make it that you only need to update these values

237
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,935
And then if you get update gets updated all over in the

238
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:57,215
Bottom of the code

239
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,311
And it makes it just much more easy to

240
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
To change your custom

241
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:03,615
Fields

242
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,151
So it

243
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:07,967
Build a field called preacher name

244
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,295
Which again it uses here as a object value

245
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,440
Because it

246
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,976
Retrieves the object

247
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,256
From the database

248
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,048
and it looks as if that object

249
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:22,816
exists

250
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:24,864
it actually reiterates

251
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
And builds up

252
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,168
option list

253
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Which is returned to use in the drop down

254
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
So it dynamically generates your list

255
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,896
and so component builder through that infrastructure through what I

256
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,432
Just explained here

257
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:41,760
Actually compiles all of that code for you

258
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:45,600
And puts it in the right file in the right place and all of that

259
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:51,232
And obviously once you build a component and you know where you have made those changes in

260
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,512
Builder

261
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
You can go look at those files

262
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:57,632
If you know how to build a Joomla website

263
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,960
I used the same conventions as decor

264
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:04,032
In regards to implementation

265
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
Of your files

266
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Ok

267
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,480
At the moment we are only pulling values that are published

268
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
This is what it is all about

269
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,856
That is the custom fields

270
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:19,904
I feel like I am

271
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Maybe just

272
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,048
Mumbling on without purpose so let's get out of this one

273
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,424
I think we can quickly look

274
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,448
At this

275
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
One which is this manual file list

276
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,312
Dropbox

277
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,616
This one is much more advanced

278
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:42,688
What we are dealing with here

279
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
Is a file

280
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,760
That actually

281
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
Is stored if I look here in it

282
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,256
What I did is I created a function in my component

283
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
Global helper function

284
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,352
Called get Dropbox links

285
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,400
it tells it that it

286
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
wants manual links

287
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,728
And it passes a

288
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Specific

289
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
variable

290
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,056
2

291
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:11,872
And it would return a bunch of links

292
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,200
And those links it will check if it exists

293
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,064
Check the array not only that it is an array but it actually has values in it

294
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,392
And if it does it actually just backs it into the

295
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Options

296
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,440
And gives it

297
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,464
Over to

298
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
The options array to the list

299
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,048
Now

300
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,096
This part here

301
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,680
Means that you can in your

302
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,704
Custom field types

303
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:39,520
You can add a helper

304
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
Static

305
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Method call

306
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
If you know what those two symbols there mean

307
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:49,248
It means it's a static method

308
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
Being called

309
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
From a class

310
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,392
Now this class is something that if you

311
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,488
know the Joomla API and know how to work builder component

312
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
You will know that

313
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,352
You can add to any component what is known as a

314
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:06,400
Component Helper class

315
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:07,424
Now

316
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,984
If I was to go to summon distributor

317
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,056
The component helper class is always

318
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Located

319
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:16,128
In

320
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
The helper

321
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,688
Folder of

322
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:21,248
The admin as well as the site View

323
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
The admin is then in the back end in which

324
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,112
Administrative components

325
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
And then

326
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,952
There is the component

327
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
And there is it's helper

328
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Folder

329
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,096
And the front end  you have the same convention

330
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:37,376
componant

331
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:39,936
sermon

332
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:40,960
distributer

333
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,520
And there is the helper

334
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,312
Structure

335
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,128
Ok and here is some of the

336
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Java

337
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,688
Script the

338
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,016
Components sorry which sermon distributor structures

339
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
Through it's helper structure

340
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
There is the

341
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,648
Helper file for the front

342
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,952
And here

343
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
helper file

344
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
For the back

345
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,608
How to add methods

346
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,144
Do they already

347
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
Helper files

348
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:15,008
Have you don't want to know what all the custom helpers is

349
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
That we ship

350
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
With all components

351
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,128
You can open component Builder

352
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
You can go to the compiler

353
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Sorry compiler not controller

354
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,784
Go to Joomla 3

355
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:29,856
And then look for the helper file in the site helper file

356
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
If you open it

357
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:36,256
You see whole lot of helper methods obviously with a lot of Place holders

358
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,792
Which we will

359
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,072
Customised for each

360
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:39,840
Component

361
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
so that it Targets that component

362
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,776
And you see there's a Json to string method here that's to get bars

363
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
there's a get bar singular

364
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,176
This is just to get one variable from the database we don't need to always to rewrite

365
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,456
.

366
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
This whole string

367
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,784
To get just one variable

368
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:01,344
You can actually come and

369
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,160
Look at how this works and use this

370
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
To get a variable from the database

371
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,024
We also have is published to

372
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
Check if a

373
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:10,816
Specific

374
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,352
Object is published

375
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
I get actions

376
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:14,656
But again

377
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,704
This is way beyond the scope of

378
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Just looking at custom

379
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
Fields

380
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:25,152
We will go into great depth into all the features of a helper structures

381
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
That when we deal with advanced concepts

382
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:32,832
But I'm just giving you a heads up so at least you can start looking at it and

383
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
Possibly get yourself going

384
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,928
We are I wrote these

385
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,000
Functions check object check array check string

386
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,536
Check Json

387
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,328
Shorten

388
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Merge arrays

389
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,656
Save string

390
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
And

391
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
Escape HTML

392
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
Replace numbers this one I'm using

393
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
quite often

394
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,616
You know if you basically do

395
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,152
Save string

396
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:02,016
We change every number in the string immediately

397
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
to

398
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:03,552
Text

399
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,880
So that you can be sure whatever you get back from safe string

400
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,160
Doesn't have numbers in it

401
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,488
This is sometimes quite necessary in fact

402
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
All the time

403
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,376
Especially if you don't know if there might be a number is that

404
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
First

405
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
Character might be a number

406
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
This way we are insuring that

407
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:23,776
it Always

408
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:25,056
It's actually text

409
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
Ok so there is just a whole bunch of

410
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
Custom

411
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,944
Methods that we ship

412
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,272
With all components that are developed so if you were to

413
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
Open

414
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Like I have said

415
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,368
Sermon Distributors

416
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:40,928
Custom

417
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Sorry

418
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:42,976
Helper

419
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
class

420
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,560
You see that these helper classes are now

421
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
all Showing up here

422
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:50,656
get actions

423
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
Shorten string merge array

424
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:59,360
So you can come and any of you feel that the methods that I have to used here is archaic or

425
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:00,384
Outdated

426
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,224
Please go on the forums at Github and talk with me about it

427
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
All very gladly look at it

428
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
and see

429
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,648
I know I recently tried to improve on this check

430
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
String

431
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
By doing

432
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,208
That

433
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:18,048
So I could actually dump

434
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,328
The part and

435
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:21,888
Save on

436
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
the Query

437
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:23,936
But

438
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,728
For some strange reason

439
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
This started

440
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Causing problems

441
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:33,408
All over and strings that were strings were being returned as not being

442
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
strings

443
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,016
But what I can tell you is that

444
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,552
I

445
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,576
Obviously

446
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:42,112
Went back to the old

447
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,136
School way of doing it

448
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,952
which is This way

449
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,768
I don't know

450
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,816
There might be an easier way

451
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,864
Obviously we first one to ensure

452
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,144
That it's set

453
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,192
That actually

454
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,984
This value is set

455
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:04,640
And then it is string and then it actually has a length you see something can be a string and yet don't have a length

456
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,712
I might be wrong on that and yet this is what I found

457
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:12,832
I've only been coding and PSP for 3 years now so

458
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
I'm definitely

459
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,648
You get teach me a few things

460
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,696
You been at it longer than I am

461
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,024
Ok

462
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,072
Back to the UI

463
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:26,656
That is where I get these values so showing it to you

464
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,680
In here

465
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Go up a bit

466
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Says get Dropbox links C

467
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Now

468
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
We see that

469
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,408
Has this thing of return

470
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,456
Which is set to false

471
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,296
Now that means if I only was to say

472
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
That it should return the manual

473
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,624
Values

474
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,720
Then it will only return the value manual links

475
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,256
But since I've said it

476
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:53,024
to 2

477
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,120
It will actually return all of those links and not just

478
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:57,888
One of them

479
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:01,728
Ok so because you can actually target that it returns

480
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,520
One specific sermons link

481
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,312
So this method is

482
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,080
Quite dynamic

483
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,152
And that's all that I'm calling

484
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
In in this

485
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:13,760
Advanced

486
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Field type

487
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,344
Which is called custom field

488
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:20,672
And it gives me a link of all the

489
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
Sorry an array of all the links

490
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
Which I didn't just load like I have explained

491
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,144
Ok so that is again as you can see quite

492
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,984
Advanced implementation of this

493
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,008
Custom fields

494
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
And

495
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,568
Obviously

496
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
As you

497
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
As I hope you would realize

498
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,920
Is there you can do anything

499
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:44,736
You can with that list conception

500
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:47,552
You could even grab a bunch of website names from somewhere

501
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,672
You can put any PHP in there and build a list which can be used

502
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,952
To save to the database

503
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,792
Ok let's see that would be the custom

504
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:02,400
Custom Fields there's also one called custom user

505
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:07,264
Now the custom user at the moment it doesn't look like I have any

506
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,544
in the demo data

507
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,568
for you

508
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,360
So I just click on new

509
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,664
And then select

510
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
Custom user

511
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,736
And

512
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,552
You'd see that the custom user basically

513
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:22,368
You don't need to set or changed

514
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,904
Change anything

515
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
From

516
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,464
Here to there

517
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
All those should actually just work

518
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,632
the only parted you might want to consider removing

519
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,912
Would be

520
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:35,936
The

521
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
PHP

522
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,008
This part here

523
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,592
Basically what this part does

524
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,640
Is it limits the

525
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,944
The user list

526
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,992
To only a certain

527
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
Group

528
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,112
That means again you need to set up a global

529
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,184
Value in your component

530
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,720
Field

531
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
In your

532
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,024
Global

533
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,560
remember we talked about that previously

534
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
Basically the options button

535
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,400
If you click on options

536
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,496
It Opens a Place which you said Global these are all

537
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,544
Global values this is a

538
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,824
Area for Global

539
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,384
Values

540
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Now

541
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,016
You can get hold of those Global values through the component helper

542
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,064
Getparams with a component

543
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Name

544
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,112
And get

545
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
When there you would place the field name

546
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:32,000
So that's how you can get a value from your Global settings

547
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,816
And basically I'm getting a specific

548
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,376
Groups value and placing it in here

549
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,424
And then I am

550
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:42,752
Returning that group that's all this part is doing

551
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:43,776
In fact

552
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:45,824
Those two sections are actually independent

553
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,408
So this one

554
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
Is what helps you

555
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Set

556
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:55,040
Ok I wanna just return a specific group

557
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:56,576
This part

558
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,600
Helps you

559
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,136
Set

560
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,952
Any users you want to exclude

561
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,792
Now this specific feature here

562
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:11,680
Ensures that only one record per user is set so let's say a user has already been

563
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,728
Added to a previous record

564
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:15,264
Then

565
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:18,080
That user should not show up again

566
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:20,128
It should be removed from the list

567
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,920
So this is what this

568
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,200
PHP is doing

569
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,016
It's simply looking to this current View

570
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
And checking if the

571
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,368
If there is users and getting their ID's

572
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
And then setting them

573
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,440
Up in the correct manner

574
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,464
They are unique

575
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:36,000
And then returns them

576
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,280
So

577
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,352
Those are the users that already have

578
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
So if you are building something

579
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,704
Which are supposed to

580
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
To have

581
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,544
Student details for example

582
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
You don't want a

583
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,896
Student to have more than one

584
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:54,944
Entry in that table right

585
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,504
You want every student to just have one in

586
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:01,600
And so if a student already is selected

587
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:05,952
You wouldn't want them to be selected again that's what this

588
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,232
Exclude feature Actually does

589
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
How to show that to you in the code

590
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
Let's go to

591
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,168
Another project that I am

592
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,216
Working on called learning manager and modules

593
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,544
And they have a

594
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,080
Field Called student

595
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,920
Student users and user

596
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:27,968
Now

597
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:30,016
There are two kinds of

598
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,296
Ways to

599
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,064
To do this

600
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,112
One is to not

601
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,672
Allow more than one user

602
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,464
To have an entry

603
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,256
And then you would basically

604
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:47,168
The one is saying ok exclude users that already have been used

605
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:51,520
So that means if a user have been selected that whole thing that I've just explained

606
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,312
The other one

607
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:58,432
Actually returns null which means it will always show all users

608
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:01,248
And the way to have it set this to null

609
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,552
Would be simply to remove

610
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
That part

611
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Of your

612
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,416
Of the code

613
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,744
Then it will automatically set

614
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,536
This value to null

615
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,168
Now when I gets about the group part it's the same principle

616
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,008
If you don't want it to just show a specific group

617
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,848
You can actually it will also be set to null

618
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,944
like That

619
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,784
And component builder will do that

620
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,600
And all you need to do is simply remove

621
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
What is part of the code

622
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
And then it will actually

623
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
And so

624
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,536
That is true

625
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
Target a specific group

626
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,912
And also to Target

627
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:54,240
Or to remove specific users

628
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,520
So let's say

629
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
That

630
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,616
You want to remove users that

631
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Belongs to other

632
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,528
Table or other structure then all that PHP that you need to write

633
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,320
You can place on the

634
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,344
Type

635
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
phpx

636
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:12,416
So you could do

637
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
like That

638
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,816
type phpx1=

639
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:21,376
All your PHP can be placed

640
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
for excluding

641
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
And

642
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
For the group

643
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,544
It's simply

644
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
sorry not

645
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,360
Directly one

646
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
You can just

647
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:35,712
Take that

648
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
And

649
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,624
This one will be used

650
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,928
For the groups that actually says it there

651
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
Getexcluded method

652
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,536
PHP for the get group

653
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
And in the code

654
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
Which is stored under Fields models

655
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:58,752
You see what it will do so you can do things and then come and look

656
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,544
What did component builder build

657
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
How does it

658
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:03,104
Look

659
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,664
Then you can actually go to the view

660
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,456
like we have here

661
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,576
And see does it's actually work is the preachers showing up

662
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:16,160
And then you can use firebug

663
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
like That

664
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,072
And you can look ok so

665
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,352
That one is

666
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
Index

667
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
Here is a select list

668
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,616
And here you have the values

669
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,920
So that's the ID

670
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,224
And that is the actual name of the speaker

671
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,784
and the ID and the name

672
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,344
So that is how it should

673
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
Display the data in

674
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
Component Builder

675
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,744
Sets up the XML structure that Joomla uses

676
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:55,072
to build this actually

677
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,608
Joomla is Building this whole structure

678
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
For you

679
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,936
So even this nice button and everything

680
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
is Joomla's handiwork

681
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,264
It is doing that

682
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
For you

683
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
And

684
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,616
This is all done through these

685
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,384
XML

686
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
Input values that you are adding here

687
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,736
So you would change the type to

688
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,296
You might say staff members

689
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,184
Oh yes there is something to

690
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,720
To remember here

691
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
The type names

692
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,560
May not have under scores

693
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,376
Or any spaces in them

694
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,704
Fact anything that is not translatable

695
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,496
Usually needs to be

696
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,520
you know

697
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
Not not have any underscores

698
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,640
Sorry not have any spaces

699
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,688
So you can't do this

700
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,528
That would it will just not work

701
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,808
So you must

702
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,344
Remove the underscore

703
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:52,416
You can do that but that's

704
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
Sort of

705
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,768
I Think it will be made lowercase anyway

706
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,072
So you could just

707
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:05,216
And then it will work because that is used not only

708
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:06,496
In the file

709
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,800
Database but it's also used in the name convention

710
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,872
and Everywhere this file type

711
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,408
So as you can see

712
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
In here

713
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,480
That file type is called studentusers

714
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
And even the file is

715
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,088
called that

716
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,624
And here it is called

717
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
Student user and here it is called student user

718
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
And this one is with the s

719
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
that one with a s in the file is also with a s

720
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:36,448
So you can see that that that specific name type

721
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,216
Name

722
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,496
Is used everywhere

723
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:40,800
And you cannot have underscores

724
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,336
In this class name

725
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,152
Neither in this type name

726
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:48,480
You know maybe you can but

727
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,552
So far my experience is that it doesn't work

728
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
If you do

729
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Have it

730
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,392
So for some reason it

731
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
It doesn't work

732
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,488
So that's just a heads up on

733
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,536
Naming of this type

734
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,144
And so you can update these Fields they are mostly

735
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,424
Feels that are

736
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
Sort of

737
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:09,472
Related

738
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
To all the other fields

739
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,080
But this one specifically says extends user

740
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,640
Ok so it actually

741
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
Shows you how it's gonna extended

742
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:23,552
So if you removed all the PHP then this field as it is now

743
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,088
Whould show all users evertime

744
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Ok

745
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
So let me just

746
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,184
Close out here

747
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,256
That is looking at the advanced field type called

748
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
User

749
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
Custom user

750
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:38,400
Another one we need to look at is the repeatable fields

751
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:42,752
Repeatable fields is actually not that difficult

752
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,568
But you need to understand how it's sort of structure

753
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:49,920
You need to first create the fields that you want to repeat

754
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
Inside of repeatable fields

755
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,040
The way repeatable field structure looks

756
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:56,320
In Joomla

757
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,344
I mean

758
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,624
When we look at it

759
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,696
in the actual application let me

760
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
See where did I used a repeatable field

761
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
OK here we have one

762
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,960
So this from there

763
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,544
all the way to there is one repeatable field

764
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
And

765
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:22,944
If you know a little XML and you worked with repeatable Fields you'll see that

766
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,224
Here is the

767
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,016
The fields that are being repeated

768
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Inside

769
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
of the  Repeatable field

770
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,280
So basically repeatable field is a field type that has

771
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,328
Other Fields inside of it

772
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:42,400
Now you don't need to write any of this

773
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
The way you would

774
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,728
Structure a repeatable Fields actually

775
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:46,752
Very very simple

776
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,824
You first create the fields that you want to

777
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,592
Repeat

778
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:53,919
And do realize you can't use repeatable fields in repeatable fields

779
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:58,783
But you can use custom advanced fields in repeatable fields

780
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,831
So if you look at that

781
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:02,367
We have here again

782
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:06,207
You see there is a field type called cause and risks

783
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,999
Now you if know Joomla

784
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:11,583
You know there is no such field type cause and risks

785
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:16,191
So that means this is a custom field so if I were to go to fields

786
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,519
You see that there is a field called here cause

787
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,799
Cause and risks

788
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:22,591
And it basically

789
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:24,383
Get set information

790
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,663
From

791
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,479
From this database table

792
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,527
This is another component

793
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,807
That I've done with component builder

794
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:34,111
And it

795
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
Is

796
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
Displaying

797
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,719
those data also making some model changes to the data

798
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,535
And adding some

799
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:42,815
Some style to it

800
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,863
nonbreaking space and stuff like that

801
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,471
Ok so that is that is just dealing with

802
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:52,543
 the Cause and risks

803
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,615
So looking again at our repeatable field

804
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:58,175
You're able to add an advance custom field

805
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
Inside of it

806
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,503
But what you need

807
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,527
To add it

808
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:03,551
Is let's

809
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,575
Open

810
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Females

811
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,623
For our example

812
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:09,695
As you need to have the field ID

813
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:13,023
And you need to order it according to

814
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:16,351
 the order you want to displayed in the

815
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
Line

816
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,167
Where you do repeatable fields

817
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,471
So if we If we close here and then

818
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,823
we go back to

819
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:29,151
Creating a new admin view and I click on fields

820
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,735
You see that there is 1 2 3 4 5 6

821
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,783
7 8 9 10 11

822
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
12 13

823
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Fields

824
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
In one row

825
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,231
And if I click next and they all appear again

826
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:45,279
And if I click next they all appear again

827
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,351
And that's what repeatable Fields really is about

828
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,959
Now this structure these Fields if we

829
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:55,519
Would you look at it how did I develop

830
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,799
This specific

831
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:57,823
Pop-up

832
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,103
Repeatable

833
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:01,407
Structure well I can show that to you

834
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:06,015
Here is a list of all the repeatable fields that I've already built

835
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,551
This three pages of 20

836
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,391
If we were to click on add

837
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,927
Files

838
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
No wait we were lookingat add

839
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Fileds let's see add fields add fields

840
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,143
There it is addfields for views

841
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Open that

842
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
So this is the repeatable field for adding fields for

843
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Views

844
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:33,663
And all you see here as I'm saying ok you could add 800 fields it way over kill

845
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
But ok

846
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,295
And we call him the button

847
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
Add

848
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
So if we go back to

849
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,367
the view

850
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,159
See it says add

851
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,023
And then I'm adding an ID in a class to it

852
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
A description which if we were to hover over it

853
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Here

854
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,703
It has a little setup fields for this view

855
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:58,495
Which is the description

856
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,031
Same there see

857
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,335
And the label is fields

858
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,103
So it says

859
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
There fields

860
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
And

861
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
Then the icon is list

862
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:10,783
Now the icon

863
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,831
Is what is shown in the button

864
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,367
That is a list

865
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,439
All the custom Joomla icons

866
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
are

867
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,999
You can can be used

868
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:24,351
How to know these icons you should go to let me see

869
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
There is a URL

870
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,959
Docs.joomla.org

871
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,983
/

872
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:33,823
J3.x: Joomla_Standard_Icomoon_ 

873
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:34,847
fonds there you go

874
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,687
That is the URL

875
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
And you'll get to this page

876
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,015
And

877
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,831
These are all the available icons

878
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
And you basically use that

879
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,439
that part

880
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
well this part

881
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:54,047
So if I wanted to checkmark-circle

882
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,095
Copy checkmark-circle

883
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,375
And I would

884
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,703
Sorry in here

885
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
Simply

886
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:02,751
The icon

887
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:03,775
Change that to

888
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,847
checkmark-circle

889
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,127
Ok

890
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:10,175
So that's how you change the icon

891
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:13,247
And then these are Simply the ID's

892
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:15,039
Of the fields I want

893
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
Inside of the repeatable field

894
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Ok

895
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
And so if I was to

896
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,767
Show you where to get the ID

897
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:28,095
It simply would be close close your

898
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
Repeatable field

899
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,959
And you'd see the ID is next to the fields there on the right

900
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
So you would create 

901
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:36,799
The the

902
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,103
Repeatable field that you o sorry

903
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,455
The fields that you wanna use in the repeatable field

904
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:48,831
And you would get a list of those ID's jotted down so maybe somewhere a Notepad or something

905
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
Just add them in the

906
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:53,183
In the order that you want them to be

907
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
Added

908
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,767
And then inside of your repeatable field

909
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,815
You would simply

910
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,375
Pasted in the fields

911
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:03,167
Area with a comma separating them

912
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:06,751
And then component builder will

913
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Dynamically

914
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,823
Construct this whole structure

915
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:10,591
For you

916
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
And add it

917
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
To your

918
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Component

919
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:18,783
I think it's really Stunning and I hope you enjoy using

920
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
the repeatable fields

921
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,343
Structure

922
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,231
I know it's little buggy still and there's a lot of talk about it not being as

923
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
Stable

924
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:34,911
But you're more normal basic Fields like text Fields and radio Buttons and so forth they all work

925
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,519
Well now the only thing about the radio buttons that use that you use in

926
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
In the in the

927
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
in the repeatable fields

928
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,895
You need to remove the class

929
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,455
Of your radio button

930
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,503
So It cannot be a button

931
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
It must be a dot

932
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
Unfortunately it still they don't

933
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:54,879
Yet make it possible to

934
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,927
actually load  the button

935
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:58,207
Now what's the difference

936
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:00,255
Well the difference is let me see if I can quickly show you

937
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:08,191
That is the button

938
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,215
version

939
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:10,239
Of a radio button

940
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,263
Ok

941
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
And

942
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:15,103
That is the

943
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
Dot version

944
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,663
Of the radio button

945
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:19,711
And it doesn't look like a button

946
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:23,039
And so in your repeatable Fields you cannot use the button version

947
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,343
It needs to be this one

948
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
And what makes it a button is obviously the class

949
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
That is

950
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:31,487
Being added to the field

951
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:33,535
So you need to remove the class

952
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:35,071
uh

953
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Values

954
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,119
From your radio button

955
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:37,887
If it's gonna be used in the

956
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
Repeatable field

957
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,751
But anyway if you forgot

958
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:45,055
To do that and you compile your 

959
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:45,823
component

960
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:49,663
And now you looking at the repeatable field you'll see that the radio button is

961
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,711
You know that it's not working

962
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:55,039
That it is messed up

963
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,343
Until they possibly fix it

964
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
This is unfortunately the case

965
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,999
Ok that is looking at advanced field

966
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,023
Sorry fields

967
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
called custom Fields custom user fields

968
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,143
As well as repeatable fields

969
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:13,471
These are really the advanced field types that there are

970
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:18,847
The other thing that I wanted briefly mentioned let me see how long if we already been

971
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
At this

972
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,687
Ok see this is getting a little long

973
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
So

974
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Let's move

975
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
What I wanted to share to a later topic

976
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
Thank you for watching
