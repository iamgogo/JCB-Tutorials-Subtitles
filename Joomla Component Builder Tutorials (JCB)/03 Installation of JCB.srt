1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:06,400
Ok here we are in component builder at the dashboard in the back

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
End of a Joomla website I would like to

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:19,200
first show you may be the tremendous power of what it's already

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:25,600
Able to do and then step back little by little showing you how to build a component

5
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:32,000
So I'll first show you components that I have build and how I have been able to

6
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:38,400
To manage them so I've got a few here obviously got a lot a lot in

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Archive But these are few that I've done and as you can see there is component Builder

8
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:51,200
for developers there's component builders for developers and how to's

9
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
And there's the three component builders and they are all three of them are living inside the same

10
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:04,000
Component builder the only change between them is really the

11
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:10,400
The database in certain things that they compile but they all are using

12
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
The same admin views they all using the same

13
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:23,200
Infrastructure information settings and so forth

14
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
So really it is it is that simple to have one component

15
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:36,000
And have it in different versions made available to your clients and

16
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,400
with all possible in component builder by Simply copying one and then making changes to

17
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
that copied one now it links to views and all that I'll explain as we continue

18
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
What I need to do now is I'm simply gonna take the compiler

19
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
And I'm gonna compile the public the free one because I'm gonna use that to show you

20
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
How to build your own component ok so I'll compile it

21
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:14,400
which start up the compiler and all the script taking all the data in the database

22
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:20,800
and puts it into the code that we would then need to run the application

23
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:27,200
Ok it's done compiling as you can see

24
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:33,600
it tells me how many lines is written it tells me how many hours I saved if I had to write

25
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:40,000
those lines manually you can read through some of that it's quite interesting obviously

26
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
I spend much more hours on this than what they says there but that's why these are just estimates

27
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:52,800
And based on calculating the 9 numbers and not really

28
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:59,200
Calculacting the actual interaction that we've had you can install the

29
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:05,600
Component if you've done it right just click in there or you could download it and install it

30
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:12,000
elsewhere or we could use this URL which is now at the moment relating to my offline

31
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
Environment and once you've done whatever you wanted to do if you click this

32
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:24,800
Whom you needed it but if you're running on the online

33
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:31,200
Environment and you use some of these links to install it elsewhere then play

34
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
Please remember to clear your temporary folder because if your don't this component

35
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:44,000
Can be downloaded in your temporary folder and to show you that it me open that website

36
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:50,400
And then let's go to it's temporal temporal folder

37
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:56,800
And you can see there is the component in a zip file and

38
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:03,200
And you you realise that anyone that can access this file can download it

39
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:09,600
So just let you know it I'll be mentioning this a few times because I realised part of why

40
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Are you might be interested in using my application is because you want to ensure that what you do remains

41
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:22,399
Yours and this is part of what you need to know to ensure that

42
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:28,799
Ok I'm gonna run a I have a bash script that reminds me

43
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:35,199
That I haven't made a commit on this so that's just my own little

44
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
Script let me quickly do that before we go on ok

45
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
it's done I'm gonna open a test website and I'm

46
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:54,399
Gonna run everything there let me just login ok so I'm in the installing

47
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,799
Area is basically a blank test website just installed

48
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
And I'm gonna use this link here I use a URL

49
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
paste it in there and click install it should say the following to you

50
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,999
When you have done that just a side note if you've started working with component Builder

51
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:26,399
As a free version and you've purchased obviously one of the paid versions

52
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:32,799
The difference between them is only the data that is in the database the features and the functionalty

53
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,335
Are all the same

54
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
And so if you have installed the free version

55
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:41,759
You would need to now add the database

56
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,831
Information from the paid versions

57
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:49,183
Now to access the database information in your component

58
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,975
Let me see

59
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:55,327
I'm gonna go to the zip file here in my file system hold on

60
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,679
Ok we've got the zip file open here

61
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:01,727
Would go to admin

62
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
Then go to

63
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
SQL

64
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,383
Then you'd see there is an install file

65
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
Now this Install file

66
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
You'd wanna open it

67
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
And

68
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:19,135
Guarantee you would see it  it's the file that we are using to build a database

69
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
And

70
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,743
Once you've come finished looking at all the

71
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:27,839
Tables at the very bottom of the file

72
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,631
After the tables

73
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:32,191
Will be dumped information

74
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,287
Now with the free version It's basically the field types

75
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
That we've added

76
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:40,127
And also some

77
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:44,479
I think help menu information

78
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:45,759
If I'm correct. I think I've added that

79
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Anyway

80
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,255
With the paid version there will be many more

81
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,559
or much more details there

82
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,095
And

83
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:05,727
and there are two ways for you to do this one would be simply to uninstall the free version

84
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,543
and install this one that you purchased

85
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:11,615
When you do updates it will never

86
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,919
Update this information

87
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,503
Joomla only uses this when it doesn't fresh install

88
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,087
Because that's the only time you create the tables

89
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,719
I didn't add this data to and install instance since that would be

90
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,255
Way too much

91
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,279
And

92
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,815
So I've realised that

93
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:36,191
They are I might look at building a script that could deal with this but I haven't done so yet

94
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:41,055
The second way to do this is if you might know My SQL

95
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,335
You can actually

96
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:47,967
Cut and paste this into My SQL replace this with your prefix of your tables

97
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
But first remove

98
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:52,831
The data that are in this tables

99
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:55,391
Let me show you that please hold on

100
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:59,487
So here we're in My SQL and there is the

101
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,767
Database

102
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,863
Tables of component Builder

103
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:09,727
And if you look at our archive were is it now this one

104
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
You see that this is gonna target the field types

105
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:14,847
So

106
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,639
You go to field types

107
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,943
If you're now importing the new data

108
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,015
And you go to operations

109
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:22,783
And you

110
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
Truncate that table

111
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,111
Like that

112
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Then you go to My SQL

113
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,815
The sequel button

114
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,375
You go back to that file

115
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
Obviously

116
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
First replace

117
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,263
All those with the

118
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,407
Prefix like that

119
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:54,015
Let's make sure we don't by accident grab the wrong

120
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:56,575
stuff

121
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
So we have it like that

122
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:17,311
Match case

123
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Says backwards

124
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,407
And then

125
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:22,687
Find

126
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:26,271
So we would replace that

127
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
I'm gonna have to replace all

128
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:35,231
Here we go back to our data you would see it now I has updated this field there

129
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,279
So I would select that

130
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,375
Like that

131
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,655
Copy

132
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Go here

133
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
To My SQL

134
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,407
paste it

135
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
And click

136
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
Go

137
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,231
Test

138
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:17,215
The mistake I made is to leave to underscores in that name there

139
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
should just use one

140
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
Let's try again

141
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,735
Ok it's added it

142
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,551
So that is how you would

143
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:33,343
Add the data

144
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:34,111
Without

145
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,647
Uninstalling

146
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,183
The whole component

147
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,255
But I would suggest that this is maybe

148
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,559
More advanced than and difficult

149
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
And not ideal

150
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,471
So the other way would be to go to the extensions manage

151
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
And click on

152
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:55,103
This manage area here

153
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,383
Select

154
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Component

155
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,271
And just uninstall it

156
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,903
And then reinstall the one that you now could download from VDM.IO

157
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
So once you've have

158
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:13,791
Got it installed it should look like this in the backend

159
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:16,863
You should be no components

160
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
No

161
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,447
Nothing while the free version

162
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,239
Should have none of this

163
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,871
The only things that will have his the field types and only a few of them

164
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:33,503
Now the paid version looks different and so I'm gonna uninstall this free one

165
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:39,903
And then I'm gonna install the paid one so we can use that as our example let's go

166
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Uninstall and as you can see it not only remove the component but it also

167
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,911
Removes any trace of it that was integrated into Joomla

168
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
These three and tags and all that

169
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
Which is quite smart because then if you install it again it's doesn't start creating duplicate values in the database

170
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,503
Ok so let's quickly get the paid version

171
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,159
Ok we have it installed

172
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:15,999
So now if we go back to the component

173
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,303
And to field types

174
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
You see that it has

175
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,655
A whole lot more field types

176
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,775
And it has a few Fields setup as well

177
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,615
In fact

178
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
This is the version called

179
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,015
Developer which only has the demo component in it

180
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:42,623
I'm basically gonna use this version to show you how to build

181
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,415
Sermon distributor

182
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,695
From scratch

183
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,303
So I possibly would skip certain things because it might get too long

184
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,351
But I'll certainly show you

185
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:55,935
From the ground up how 7 distributor is to be built

186
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,751
And I'm gonna do it inside this version

187
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,335
And at least we have something to start with

188
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,871
Ok well

189
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,663
That's enough for this tutorial

190
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,711
We'll continue with

191
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
Field types in the next
