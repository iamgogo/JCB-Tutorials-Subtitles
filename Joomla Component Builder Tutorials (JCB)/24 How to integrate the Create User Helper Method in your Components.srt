00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:01,792
Hi

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:06,912
I would like to give you a quick tutorial or demonstration on how to use

3
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:09,472
user creation method or function

4
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:12,544
In your component

5
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
What is the user

6
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:17,152
Creation function

7
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
It is basically a part of code's helper function actually

8
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:27,904
That gets added to the helper class

9
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,232
If you don't know where the helper class is let me quickly show you

10
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,304
now if you go to your

11
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,840
repository where you

12
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:39,168
Find basically your Joomla install

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,472
you would go to administrator

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:46,848
Now there is a helper class for the front end of every component as well as for the back end

15
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:49,152
so looking in a backend

16
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,200
We go to component

17
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,320
Expert Database

18
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:58,112
Helpers

19
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,696
And it's basically that file there

20
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,976
that is the helper

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,768
Class if we open it we

22
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,864
See that it's the abstract expert database helper

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:11,936
Now that helper class gets included

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Into your component on every page so if you to open the main backend file with that one

25
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:24,736
Which get loaded by Joomla first you'll see that it actually

26
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:27,808
includes that helper file in every page

27
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:30,880
So that means everything inside of that

28
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:35,232
Class is available to you everywhere in your component

29
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:40,096
When we actually go back to our

30
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,888
Interface

31
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:44,704
And we go to components

32
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,544
and the Expert Database

33
00:01:55,456 --> 00:02:01,600
You would see that there is a libs or actually stand for library and helpers and you see

34
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
We have to switch Ticked yes add create user helper method

35
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
Set to yes

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,328
That is the

37
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:14,144
The switch that you need to trip

38
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:18,752
So that component builder and knows that you actually want the helper class

39
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,056
that Creates users to be

40
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,920
Added to the helper class of your front and backend of your

41
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,688
component

42
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
I'm gonna close out here

43
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:33,088
I am going to go back to the code

44
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
And then I am going to do a

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,952
Simple search

46
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,024
for user

47
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,400
.

48
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:55,104
Here is quite a few users

49
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,176
there it is

50
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
Create user

51
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,808
As you can see this is a public static function

52
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:06,368
So you would basically call it with that class name

53
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,584
Then colon colon

54
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:18,656
and the name of the function, right

55
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
which is create user

56
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,800
And you see that it is set to new

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,848
Now

58
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:28,896
New has in it

59
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:32,224
A few variables is basically an array

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
So you can go through this class and you'd see that it has a password one or is just password or password two, it has a user name

61
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,512
it has a name

62
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
aswell as a e-mail

63
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:47,840
And

64
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
it then creates the user

65
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:55,776
That's what this class does so it calls in the Joomla

66
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
Component users

67
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
It calles in it's registration model

68
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:09,856
And then it basically uses that model to create a user so that's what that switch does it

69
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:16,256
adds this class to your component you can then use it in your component it doesn't automatically

70
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
just sets everything else in place you still required to do as a developer to add to correct code

71
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:26,495
I'll show you what I have done and how I am using it

72
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
There is a admin View called experts it's in this view that I would actually like

73
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,575
Option for someone to create a user now let me first demonstrate how it works

74
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,415
So I would go to expert data base and click on experts

75
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,279
Let's click on new

76
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:55,167
So you would see there is a

77
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
field called Expert

78
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
With which you can select

79
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,591
Users within a specific group

80
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,175
I will also explain some of that more later

81
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,503
But underneath there is this button create user

82
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,879
If you Click on it it basically has a pop-up where in you enter a user name

83
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:17,439
I am just gonna say

84
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Testing

85
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,303
123

86
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,143
Use that as the username

87
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,191
And as the password

88
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
There we go, got the user name

89
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,943
So everything is testing 123

90
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,855
And if I click create it basically has this nice effect

91
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
where it is busy creating it

92
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,767
Setting it up, sending out the email doing all of that for you

93
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
And once it's done

94
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:58,911
It lets you know that user was created successfully

95
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:01,727
and the login details was e-mailed to the user

96
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,311
And then it says here ready to select

97
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:10,175
You can now select testing 123 that you just created from the user list

98
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,015
In the above field simply click on the blue user icon

99
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Click here

100
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,903
and you can type in that testing 123

101
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:22,463
click Search

102
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,511
And there is the user created

103
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,815
and we click enter

104
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,935
You see that it basically used a very strange conversion here

105
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:37,055
Basically converting the username away from the numbers now you can you can fix that

106
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:40,383
By clicking edit

107
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:45,759
And then changing it to 123 and say save the update

108
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,879
Does not want to allow that.

109
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:56,767
So clearly my little application doesn't wanna allow you to use

110
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,119
actually any numbers in the user name,.That's not the point

111
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:04,959
The point is that we have this integrated user now that is connected to an expert

112
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,775
And if you were to click there again

113
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,687
You can still selected ok but once you select it once you can't create a new expert

114
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
And select that user again

115
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:21,087
So it's basically one profile connecting to one user

116
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,391
To set up a expert

117
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,303
So that's the feature I'm using it for there is different ways that I have implemented this let me show you another one

118
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,399
Obviously you realise I'm using a lot of JavaScript on this page

119
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:36,703
I will show you some of that JavaScript but

120
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,263
That yourself

121
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:42,591
Ok let me just get out of here

122
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:48,479
for Example over here I wrote this job tracking Extension

123
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,599
And let's say we want to create a new job order

124
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,743
then I can say whether it's a new client or a existing

125
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,047
if it is an existing

126
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,095
I Simply select from this list

127
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,911
If it's new I click here

128
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:11,007
I can enter all the details of the user and when I click save

129
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
It Creates the user

130
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
Stores the data in the user table not in the job order table deletes all these values

131
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:24,831
So did the job order table never stores any user values in the relation of this job order of course

132
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,047
And so that's another way that I have implemented so if we were to close this out

133
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,119
And where to open a client

134
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,143
A new one

135
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,471
You would see it's basically it's the same values

136
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,519
And

137
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,103
Everything is the same

138
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:51,199
So that's another way that we integrated this whole

139
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,527
User integration

140
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:57,087
So there are really many different ways to this

141
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,511
The way I have done it I've just listen to my clients expectation

142
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:08,863
What I really would like to see and how they would like it to work

143
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,679
And then simply Make It Happen that way

144
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
I personally I prefer the Ajax Way much more

145
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,335
It's it's just seems to me easier

146
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:23,967
So let me illustrate some of or let me show you some of the code that I used to do that

147
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:29,087
Ok so we back in The Experts View

148
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:36,255
As I've done before I previously in other tutorials explained how to make use of the

149
00:09:36,511 --> 00:09:37,023
Ajax concept

150
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
Within

151
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,863
Component Builder

152
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:45,471
Now for those of you that like to understand what's going on let me give you a quick runover

153
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:48,287
At the code level

154
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,175
Within every component that makes use of Ajax

155
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,503
A model and a controller is created

156
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:04,415
The controller is named Ajax.json.php and the model is named

157
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,695
Ajax

158
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,767
Ok let me open the model

159
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,583
And also let me open

160
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,375
The controller

161
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:16,959
As you can see the controller basic fires off

162
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,775
The register tasks within the construct method

163
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:24,127
And then it adds the tasks

164
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,663
Into a switch

165
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,759
And tries to run the task basically

166
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:31,551
Also in

167
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,831
The model it

168
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,903
It Gets the model Ajax

169
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:41,535
And then runs the method that basically corresponds to the task

170
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,351
And so that is how

171
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,679
It runs

172
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:50,495
It uses the Joomlas default

173
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
Filtering

174
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:57,151
Method in the way that it gets values that are being posted

175
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:02,015
And then value dates that those values actually are there

176
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:04,831
Then sends the values over to the model

177
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:09,951
Now that's looking at it from a code side so if you look at the model

178
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:12,255
It simply shows you

179
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
Various methods

180
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,095
Some of them are protected

181
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:19,423
And some of them are public and those are usually the ones

182
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,191
That

183
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,567
gets called from the controller once the Ajax gets the

184
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,615
Verification level and it's

185
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,895
Verified

186
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,199
So here is the create user class

187
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Basically

188
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,527
We first check

189
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:40,927
Whether this user now this is custom script I mean this I wrote custom component build does not write this so

190
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
Basically when you go back to the user interface

191
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,839
You see that

192
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
If I scroll down here

193
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,311
create user fields

194
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,871
And then there's great user

195
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,919
You see that I wrote this right here

196
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:04,991
And that basically gets placed into the model

197
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
So that's the Ajax method here

198
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,671
I simply in that Ajax input

199
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:15,487
I annotate the specific tasks

200
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,535
The task name

201
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
And specific variables

202
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,143
And again the method name

203
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,215
You could have different method names from task names and

204
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,847
What should be validated whether it's integer, float or whatever

205
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
And if there's no value What is the value by Default

206
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:39,039
So this is where you set up there basically the controllers information

207
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:45,695
And then here your customised these write your script so basically

208
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:48,767
create user gets data and seems from what view is it

209
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
then validates with this

210
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
current login user has the permission

211
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,423
To actually

212
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,983
The Experts area

213
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,031
Then it

214
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:04,895
Converts the data because it's a json set of datasets that I'm sending across

215
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:07,199
So that we can see if it's an array does some other checks

216
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,183
So you can see I'm still here I'm using that

217
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,719
Global helper

218
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,023
Class and methods

219
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,095
Here are number of custom methods obviously that

220
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:28,959
That is available in that class to go through it we just added in there as freebies and

221
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,543
And you wanna always see the Need of them but I'm using them often

222
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,847
And even if you have with

223
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:40,991
Improvements on those methods please make a pull request and we'll make those changes

224
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Then you over here once we've

225
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,439
Become very sure that we've got enough data on the right data

226
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,815
We basically get that same method and we need to create user

227
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,863
Get result

228
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,655
And if it's not

229
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
the correct result we deal with it

230
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
accordingly

231
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
And if it is the correct result we create

232
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:07,359
Add the user to the user group

233
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
That's something that the user does not

234
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,223
that you create user does not do

235
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,759
So we

236
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
Then have a user group setup

237
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
And

238
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Basically in the component

239
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
And we get that user group

240
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
Set into the correct User Group

241
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,863
This is a return message

242
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,423
If it's an error

243
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,983
or whether it's a

244
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
Success

245
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,591
So down here is the error message

246
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:44,991
So if it's if it's successful this is what we do if it's unsuccessful this is what we do

247
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
And so that's just a quick look I mean obviously we can pause this video and

248
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,415
Look at

249
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,439
What I have done

250
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:58,815
And then here is getUser when the page loads initially

251
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,375
we get the id get the data

252
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
packs it into some html

253
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
And sends it off

254
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
So

255
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,823
This is the PHP side obviously

256
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
We we do this create user and then there is a ajax

257
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
Site right in Javascript

258
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,063
So

259
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
In the JavaScript when the page loads

260
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:25,951
Would you get user with the user ID

261
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,767
We get the user ID from the field

262
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
And then it loads that data that you saw

263
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,911
If you if you looked no this is the wrong place

264
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,175
Basically shows you that is the data it loads

265
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,479
And that data can be edited

266
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,527
Except over here

267
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:54,367
You cannot add numbers in the username but you can

268
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,927
do that and it will update it as you see

269
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:59,231
and will say that is updated it

270
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,279
Obviously if there is a

271
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:05,375
Error with the email already used or something it will also give you an error

272
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,959
And this is all part of how we basically have setup

273
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,775
the JavaScript

274
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
Ok we can scroll down to

275
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,431
So I've just added to Javascript to the view file

276
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,319
And here is get user the server side and there is the the function

277
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,159
I have two functions usually one that sort of deals with

278
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:32,767
Waiting and then eventually setting up the data into the The View

279
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,399
And here's one making the call so this is how you call structure would usually look

280
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,959
In index.

281
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
php

282
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,823
?option = your components name

283
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
And the task which

284
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,407
Must go to the

285
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,455
Ajax controller

286
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
And then this is the task

287
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:59,647
And you then here can stipulate what format you would like the result set returned in

288
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
if you

289
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:07,071
Want the result set returned the raw which in sometime sometimes is the case

290
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,631
There is if you look here

291
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,703
There is a raw

292
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,727
Variable

293
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
You can just set the raw variable to true

294
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
Then it will give you the results set

295
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,407
just Like that without

296
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
Braces around them

297
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,991
Or a call back or anything

298
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:29,087
You see when you make calls from JavaScript

299
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,367
It usually

300
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:32,415
Wants this call back to be added

301
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:39,327
If you make calls from other JavaScript libraries you might just want the braces around it

302
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,911
But if you want it raw which also is often the case

303
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:47,263
you just add the variable raw to the URL = true

304
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
and then end up passing it back to you with this

305
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
So that's a little heads up on

306
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,943
Ajax function so

307
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
the format must json

308
00:17:59,295 --> 00:18:00,063
that's Important

309
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,647
Ok and always use a token

310
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:09,023
Have the token on the page this token is necessary

311
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,839
To prevent cross site scripting of course

312
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,655
I usually add the token to the page

313
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
Through the

314
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:19,007
Java oh sorry php

315
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
So there is a place down here if you scroll down where is it

316
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,223
I just remembered remembered

317
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,271
If you are working in a backend

318
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,087
The backend the backend and the admin area you

319
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:37,695
don't need to have the token its get added to the page dynamically

320
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:40,767
Since we Basically parsed the JavaScript

321
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
Areas

322
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:47,679
And if we see token we actually know oh token is to be there and we add the token for you

323
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,031
Where is the front end you must actually literally add the token

324
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,335
There was just too many reasons for us

325
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,407
Not to do the Automation in the front end so but you 

326
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:03,551
could literally change to the variable name as well

327
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,343
To something of your choice

328
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,439
Where is now it's just token it's backend it's more secure ok so

329
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
You need to always add a token

330
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,303
To the request

331
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,679
and check whether the token is there if it's not that it wouldn't make a request at all

332
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,007
Ok so I was looking at another function there

333
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,615
Ok so that's simply how we create a user

334
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:32,479
And integrate the user concept within this component

335
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
I hope that was helpful I realize if you not that fluent in programming in JavaScript

336
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,695
Or in jQuery

337
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
As well as in PHP

338
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:46,303
This might not fully resolved your questions

339
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,399
Like I said where the beginning of these tutorials

340
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,471
I wasn't planning on making a component that is

341
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Very easy to use

342
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,895
but rather a Component that is very powerful to use

343
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:07,295
And leaving it up to you to decide how to implement This user integration

344
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,879
Is really the most powerful way of doing it

345
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:15,999
At least we are adding the the class with which you can create the user

346
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:20,095
And again even there you can go look at that class

347
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,655
If you feel my implementation is a little you know needs some

348
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,983
Inprovement

349
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
You can either shoot me a mail or you could

350
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Take 

351
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,151
For this component Builder on GitHub

352
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,223
Pull down to your own repository

353
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,527
Make the changes push it back

354
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
And

355
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,623
The place inside

356
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:46,975
Of component builder where this class is constructed

357
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
is obviously

358
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:50,559
Within

359
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:54,399
The compilers files. Now the compiler

360
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
Has

361
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
Has quite a few files and you need to do do a search

362
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,823
So you basically go to component Builder

363
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,615
go to helper

364
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
and then Use the compiler

365
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
And here is all its files

366
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
So do a search in here

367
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,271
For

368
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,551
the function

369
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:13,855
Create user you could

370
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:15,903
you know just search for that

371
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
and I'm sure you're fine it

372
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:24,352
and it is in that area where you need to make the adaptation and the changes because it's dynamically added

373
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,424
It is not

374
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:31,264
it can't be edited like right

375
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,592
in the script it needs to be edit in the function where we add it

376
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,920
Just go search those functions

377
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Thank you for watching

378
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:46,368
That's how you create users and connect them to your components

379
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:52,768
Obviously there is much more to say but I'm afraid this will get way too long like most of my tutorials get to long

380
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
I want to keep it this this way and trying to make it shorter hope you enjoyed that
