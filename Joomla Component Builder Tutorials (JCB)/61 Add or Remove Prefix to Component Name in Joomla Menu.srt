00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:07,680
I would like to demonstrate you the new feature of removing and adding a prefix to your

2
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,776
Component name in the Joomla menu

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:14,592
Take a look at the menu there's this little arrow

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,152
in front of Component Builder

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,200
And that's the prefix we talking about

6
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:21,760
in the past it would add that automatically

7
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:26,368
Now it will still do that but you can actually change it so

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,440
Go to the global options of a component

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:33,280
And under the global tab

10
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:37,888
You see a new area called Add Menu Prefix

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,216
And there's a little description there

12
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:42,752
And you can say no

13
00:00:43,264 --> 00:00:45,312
And then it won't have any prefix

14
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
Or you can change this to any

15
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,664
Other prefix you want

16
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:56,320
Are there you don't need to add a space here and the space is automatically done so you can check out

17
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:00,160
This list here. There is a link to a list

18
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:05,792
of HTML character entities that you need to use here

19
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:08,352
This will obviously translate to that arrow

20
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
And

21
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
You need to make sure to use something that can be it just placed inside of an XML file

22
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,592
So

23
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:23,712
That means that if you wanna use strange characters like that arrow

24
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,088
You need to use the HTML you could also use your company name or

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:33,184
You can use anything it'll basically just add that

26
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,000
As a prefix to the component name

27
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:38,560
So just of illustrate this

28
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
Let me change this a little bit

29
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:44,192
So I am grabbing the the value here

30
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:48,544
The one without the x is the one we looking for so this the & hash

31
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,336
Value this one here

32
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:54,944
I'm gonna grab that little circle with a dot. Well let's take the one with the

33
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Circle in a circle that looks nice

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,552
Ok I'm gonna take that one

35
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,112
I'm gonna add it in here

36
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,976
And I'm going to click save

37
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
Ok it's asking me to add some other info as well

38
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,424
Ok try again save and close

39
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:17,728
Now let's go and compile

40
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,008
one of the

41
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,800
demo components here

42
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,848
So you can say demo

43
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
And compile

44
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
And install it

45
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
Now you'll see it has this little circle

46
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,392
Next to the demo name

47
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,696
That's the way we can

48
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Change that little

49
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,768
Prefix

50
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:44,864
And then obviously the option to just remove it altogether

51
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:46,400
It's also there

52
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,424
Basically

53
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,544
Saying no prefix save and close

54
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:55,360
And let's do it again

55
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
Compile and

56
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,712
install

57
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:05,088
And now you'll see it's just the way usual components will look there is the demo

58
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
So this little

59
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:12,512
Prefix can be added or removed now thanks to this new feature
