1
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:04,864
I would like to demonstrate to you

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,680
How to add rules to your

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,728
Model

4
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:12,544
Basically to a field

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,848
Adding rules to a field

6
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,920
Uses your custom rules to

7
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,712
Test the value

8
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:21,760
Before actually

9
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:28,160
You know submitting it to the database so this is a quite good feature

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,208
to actually have in your component

11
00:00:30,976 --> 00:00:31,744
Now

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:38,144
I'm just gonna use this Hello World Component the one we we actually

13
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Did a Hello World tutorial on and I'm gonna add a rule to one of its Fields and then

14
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,080
Then quickly type it up

15
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,408
And show you how to include it

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,272
Ok so I've gone to admin views I'm gonna open this greeting

17
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,296
First

18
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:01,952
As the admin view we want to change the field in it

19
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,768
I think that's used his greetings

20
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,352
And let's add a rule

21
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,424
That we can call something like

22
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,752
Now we see at this time

23
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,848
That the field attributes don't have the validation

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,920
Option switch in place

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,688
So

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:29,088
We might start shipping JCB with this new validation property well not new it's

27
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,720
Just not being added yet but if you have a version of JCB that doesn't have it set

28
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:40,864
Then whatever field type you've selected you can edit the field type going here

29
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,144
Or

30
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:43,936
You could edit the field type

31
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,496
By going to field types

32
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,312
So this have to close out of this again

33
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,640
And then here field types

34
00:01:55,712 --> 00:02:01,856
And you can select the field type that you want to add this validation to we want to do it for now just

35
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,136
 to the Text area

36
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,160
This one

37
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,072
And it has a filter in place I think I'm gonna add validation just underneath it

38
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,352
So just gonna click

39
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,632
here a plus

40
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,680
It is adjustable

41
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
It's not required it's not translatable and let's give it a little 

42
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:27,200
Description ok so I think we got it all set

43
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:30,528
I wouldn't add a value here because

44
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,856
If if you don't want to use it you just leave it empty

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:40,256
And ok that's basically it let's save and closed so we've done the text area

46
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
Now

47
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:43,584
Let's go back to our

48
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,888
Admin view greetings

49
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,960
and again open that field

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:56,640
And now we have this validate a property available to us

51
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
So we can now copy it

52
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,016
And add it in here

53
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:08,416
Now we want to have a custom validation here

54
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
There are built in Joomla validations as well

55
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:18,400
But you can also set up a custom validation rule and this is what of form

56
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:19,424
rule as its known

57
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:21,984
This is what we want to demonstrate

58
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
So we gonna say

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,432
Let's call our rule strlen

60
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
Ten

61
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:35,040
So my string must be longer than 10 characters

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,624
Ok I think that should do

63
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,440
So I'm just gonna copy this again

64
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,024
And save and close

65
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
So now that we've got our validation set JCB is not yet able to well

66
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,312
We don't have an area for you to write the rule and have it be included

67
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,920
So the way you do this and I think it's it's efficient

68
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:07,552
Is it you right up the file yourself you put it in the custom folder of JCB

69
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:10,624
And you include it into the component

70
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,952
So that it places it in the correct place

71
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:18,303
You see the one thing that JCB already does for you

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:24,703
Is that it creates a folder called rules and in the forms

73
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,983
Every XML

74
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,775
If we open it

75
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:30,591
already has a field path

76
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,639
And a rule path

77
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:36,223
So you you can just add your rule to this

78
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,271
Basically to this folder

79
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:40,575
Which I will demostrate to you in the moment

80
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:43,391
But first let's create our rule

81
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:14,367
So I had it this room here so in the folder structure

82
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:21,023
I'm basically in the admin area components component builder and there is this folder called custom

83
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,815
An inside of this folder

84
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,167
I've Now created this strlenTen file

85
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:32,799
strlenTen file and then it I placed this this code here

86
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,847
Basic

87
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,991
J form rule nothing too fancy about it

88
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,879
Ok let's see now that we've got our file in place

89
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,463
We need to add it into our component

90
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:55,327
So we go to the components and we open that component

91
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
And we go to

92
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,127
Settings and there adding custom files and folders

93
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,503
We click on this component files and folders create component files and folders

94
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,295
For this Joomla component

95
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:18,367
We just click on that it's ok

96
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:21,951
And here we want to add

97
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
1 file

98
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:30,143
Since we've added it to that custom folder everything in at custom folder will come up as a file that you can

99
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,423
Select

100
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,727
So there it is that file

101
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,311
Now the path to where we want it to place the file

102
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
So in the backend of the component we go to

103
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Models

104
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,223
Forms

105
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:50,111
And we are targeting this greeting form so we opened that and we see

106
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
That it has models rules

107
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,951
So

108
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:57,023
Let's copy that

109
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,399
Now we need to remember that it is admin the admin area

110
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
And then

111
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,495
Models rules

112
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
So

113
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:14,431
This admin is basically the way the package is built so the target Place should be the place in

114
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:19,039
Inside the package this be always the case for both folders and fields

115
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
So in the

116
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Folder

117
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:26,463
You want it to add it to the admin models rules folder

118
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:30,815
And then you need to decide whether you want this file to be updated

119
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:34,655
Now at this stage that files doesn't need any updating

120
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,191
But hey we can change that

121
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,031
So you can see I've just added this

122
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:44,639
New licence tag to it

123
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,687
And I've added this BOM

124
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,503
Basically when the file gets taken

125
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,783
It will

126
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
Take this part away and replace this with your components licence and so the file

127
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,975
will basically be

128
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,255
Become

129
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:03,583
Branded like every other file in your

130
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
In your component

131
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
And that

132
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:09,983
Even if you use it in areas or components

133
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:16,383
Other than the one you originally made it for it will just dynamically looked like it was made for it because it

134
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
Add that components

135
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:25,599
Data at the header of the file and even if you had the components name somewhere else in this

136
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:30,719
You can actually replace it with the well-known

137
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:38,399
Hash hash hash component hash hash hash and it will be placed with the component name

138
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:42,495
Ok enough of that we've got our file in place

139
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,287
You wanted to be updated

140
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:48,383
And now let's compile the component and see it in action

141
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,735
So here just tick this as yes it's the file should be updated

142
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,575
And then save and close

143
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Also close out of a component again

144
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:07,327
There's no shortcut to that file area over here that you can use

145
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,375
We go to the compiler

146
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:13,983
And we compile our component

147
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:23,967
Ok it's done now let's install our component

148
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:28,063
Now let's go look at the code to see what happen

149
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:34,975
Ok so here is our components admin area If we open the rules we see ha there is a file it was

150
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:37,023
Placed into this folder

151
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
If we open that file we see ha

152
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,119
It added our

153
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,471
Copy notice to the header of the file

154
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
And now let's also look at our

155
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,359
XML

156
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,943
Scroll down

157
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:00,319
We see the validation is there strlen.Ten so

158
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,111
Everything so far so good

159
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Now let's go test this

160
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,487
So we open this component in the backend

161
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,279
We go to greetings

162
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
We click new

163
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Now as you remember

164
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,703
We said that greetings now needs to have a length

165
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
Of at least 10

166
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Characters

167
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,127
So let's test this

168
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:29,247
So we add greeting which isn't enough and we click save

169
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,807
And it tells us

170
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
Invalid field greetings

171
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,391
Problem

172
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:42,559
There's one little change I had to make to get this to work and I realize I'll need to tell you ok let's go look at this

173
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:49,727
For some reason they want this file all lowercase so I had to change strlen.Ten to the T

174
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,031
Also in lower so let's go do this

175
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,359
Also with the file in our custom folder

176
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
Then

177
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:04,063
Inside of the actual file they also want the T here to be lowercase

178
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,207
I suppose because they are using the upper case camel rule

179
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,535
To sort of break-up the the name

180
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:18,143
Let's see ok so that was what I had to do to get it to work

181
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,191
Now

182
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
I also need to just update the component to include this file since the name is changed it will no longer know where it is

183
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:31,967
So we open the component

184
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,503
You know what

185
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:37,087
Let's not open the components go directly to that file

186
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Area

187
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
With the shortcut

188
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:46,303
And we see it is no longer selected to a scroll down selected again and save and close

189
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
That should do it

190
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,471
Ok so now that we've fixed the little glitch which I created myself

191
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:57,055
Let's go back to see this again in action

192
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,847
And save

193
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:02,175
And invalid field greetings

194
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:04,223
Ok that isn't very helpful

195
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:08,319
Maybe you would like to also show a custom message

196
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,183
So that the user word least know more about what is going on here

197
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:19,327
But now before we do that let's add enough values and see if that it actually saves

198
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:25,471
And now it's saved excessively close

199
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:31,359
So our greetings been saved and how value here is more than 10 characters

200
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,895
So it was valid

201
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:38,271
Now let's go add a custom message to our

202
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Validation

203
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:45,951
Now remember whatever you do to the live version of this file

204
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,279
Will not necessarily become part of the next compilation

205
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,119
So adding a custom message you need to actually go back

206
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,679
to component builder custom

207
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,727
And to that actual file

208
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,847
And add it in there then recompile your component and it will automatically

209
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,407
Update the live demonstration

210
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:11,039
So the other way just a test before doing it live or be you know before

211
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:17,439
Adding it to the core of your component is to actually go to the live file which as we saw is

212
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,975
here in Hello World

213
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,255
Models

214
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:22,815
Rules strlen.ten

215
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:23,839
Good

216
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
Now let's add our custom message in here just to test

217
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Ok

218
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:36,639
We using the element and adding an attribute to the element message

219
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,455
Field must have more than 10 characters

220
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,551
That is one way of doing this of course there is another way

221
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:47,647
Again this takes us back to JCB

222
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,183
And we go to the field

223
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:54,303
We open greetings

224
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,911
And we look for the attribute message

225
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,727
It doesn't have message

226
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:06,591
So we need to add this attribute we'd click on field type

227
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:10,687
And we scroll down

228
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,759
I think let's place this under description

229
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,295
So we say

230
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,111
Message

231
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:20,927
It's changeable

232
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
It is translatable

233
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,327
And it's optional so

234
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,887
We don't make it compulsory

235
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,959
Ok we got all set

236
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
So

237
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:38,591
Just save and close

238
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,639
Now

239
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:44,223
Let's add this validation sorry the message

240
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,527
To our field

241
00:14:54,463 --> 00:15:00,607
Now before we save this and actually go this path let's first test our live

242
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,191
Change we made to the file and see if that also works

243
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
So in the File we added this attribute

244
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,799
To the element

245
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
And basically return false

246
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:14,175
Good now let's go test this

247
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,295
So we again open that item

248
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,111
And we take away a few characters

249
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,647
And click save

250
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:30,303
And there we get a message that it needs more than 10 characters

251
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,143
Ok great so that option also works very well

252
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:40,287
Now lets use the other one which I suppose is more convenient

253
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:46,943
Unless you are checking multiple things and you would like to give multiple error messages based on those

254
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:53,343
results then this implementation is the better option but if you just got one message and it just needs to

255
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:56,159
really explain to the user one issue

256
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:01,535
Then using the XML path I suppose is more convenient

257
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
So in our custom file we haven't added that change so

258
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,519
Let's go and compiler component and install

259
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
First we need to save and close out of this

260
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,663
Field so that the changes be captured

261
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,711
Then go to the compiler

262
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,015
And compile

263
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,831
our component

264
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
Install

265
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Lets go look at the code

266
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,839
So here in the code we see our custom message is again not showing up

267
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,239
The XML greeting we now have this translated message here

268
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
As you can see

269
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,359
Lets go test this

270
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
So again we open that field

271
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,783
And first lets just save it the way it is

272
00:16:56,063 --> 00:17:01,439
Ok good it works lets take away 2 characters and save again

273
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:08,095
And we get the expected message this time around that message can be translated

274
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:15,007
And as well it is actually in the XML file it's not part of the actual function

275
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:18,591
Ok well so I think this covers it

276
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:21,151
We have now successfully added

277
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,503
Our own validation rule to one Field within a view

278
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:32,159
And we were able to include that rule into our component on compilation are using adding custom

279
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Files

280
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:35,743
Thank you for watching
