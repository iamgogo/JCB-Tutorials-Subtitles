1
00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:06,656
Next in the component view we are gonna add the ReadMe script to a component

2
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:11,776
The reapme script is commonly used as the components

3
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:18,176
Homepage sort of so if you were to go to gethub for

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:24,576
That's open we are on the demo components page for example

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,976
Let's open GetHub and you'll see that it has this nice image here and it has some

6
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:34,816
Details and some layout

7
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:41,216
Now this all is done with the ReadMe file so it's with this file here we can open

8
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:44,544
That and then look at the Raw

9
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,480
And here you can see the It's basically the same text this we looking at previously

10
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,904
So inside of component Builder you can add this read me and read me text and

11
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,464
This is basically placeholders

12
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:04,000
Now

13
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,656
I know that that is part of the markup for a header so

14
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
You need to

15
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Know a little bit about

16
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,728
Markdown

17
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:16,032
Sorry not markup markdown

18
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:20,640
to you know what is placeholders and what is not

19
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
That is why I added The Script so you can sort of get an idea of everything that are placeholders

20
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,624
And these place holders are

21
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:37,024
Automatically updated from the details that are in these Fields here so

22
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:39,840
So you can see

23
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,888
The the actual placeholders

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,264
Names it's nice so if you change the version here

25
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
It'll updated there

26
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Automatically

27
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
So that is just read me file

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,296
Really a place for you to give a lot of information to those who are using

29
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Your

30
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,880
Application

31
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:06,464
so Maybe you can add some links to it or you could

32
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:12,096
has Some links to help menus or even instructions on installing it

33
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:17,472
or anything else that you'd like to share through the ReadMe file

34
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
I would ask if it's if it's not too much for you you know for you to leave this area this commenting

35
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
The more people using component builder the more involve within a community

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Others getting

37
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
This training set

38
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:35,136
Help us to sustain this project

39
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
So if

40
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,952
you leave that in it will certainly be helpful

41
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
you not Compulsory

42
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
I mean it's only if you want to

43
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,144
And then if you wanna know more about markup markdown

44
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
markdown not markup

45
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:52,032
Then you can open this link here

46
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
And it shows you the

47
00:02:56,896 --> 00:03:00,224
this little bit of a cheat sheet of everything that you can do

48
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,576
Ok so that is looking at the ReadMe area

49
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:06,368
This admin View area

50
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
And the site View area

51
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,048
Should be seen as a place where you can create new admin views

52
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,680
Do realize that if you create a new admin view it's not necessarily linked to this component

53
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:24,032
You need to still link it in here in settings under admin view

54
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,872
This is more a place to create admin view so if you click on new

55
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,016
Or to edit existing admin views that are linked to this component

56
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:40,416
Same goes with the site views so it's simply a way for you to to gain access to editing those

57
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,280
site views that already linked to this application easily

58
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,120
And then the third one

59
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
forth actually 

60
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
one two three four we wanna look at is the FTP server that FTP server basically been added to

61
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
Give you a hand in moving this application this component

62
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
to your server and also add the feature of that automated updating that is inside

63
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:11,392
of Joomla. So the update server

64
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,440
Is actually a Joomla concept

65
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:18,303
And if you open a component

66
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,095
So I'll open

67
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,911
Summon distributor wait over there

68
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:30,591
This is the front I need to look at the backend

69
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
And we look at the

70
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
XML file of this component

71
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
Component builder obviously built this whole file for you

72
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,743
But at the very bottom

73
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
You see that there is a

74
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
App updates server

75
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,119
That is being added

76
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,935
Now this is not added if you

77
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
Have not

78
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:59,007
Set the service it will set to no

79
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:03,103
It will not be adding an update server if you add this

80
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:05,919
Then you can set the link

81
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,247
To where the update server is you know gonna be hosted

82
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:13,087
And it will automatically take that link

83
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:16,415
in added into your XML file like it's done here

84
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:18,975
And

85
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,511
That file itself

86
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,327
Component Builder Can also build that file for you

87
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,119
The way does it

88
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
Is that

89
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
This obviously

90
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:34,591
Should look like that host = hostname

91
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,895
And port = port

92
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:38,431
Int&

93
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,991
And option bracket type

94
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:43,551
= FTP BINARY

95
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,855
Now this FTP binary

96
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:50,975
usually is 15 sorry 

97
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:55,583
That is the the default value FTP binary

98
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,679
Where is that would usually be 21 and that would usually be 15

99
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,775
And then username and a password

100
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,127
Now this FTP details should actually login directly

101
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,735
To this folder that you have up here this updates folder

102
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,271
Ok that one

103
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:21,439
So that basically all component builder does is it loggs into your server move this file in there and then this disconnects

104
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,583
And this information is what will make it possible for him to do that

105
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,959
Same goes with the sales server the sales server usually

106
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,727
Would be

107
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,799
Very much the same concept

108
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
You'de Simply be adding the same kind of string here except usually the

109
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:47,551
The update server and the sales server is not the same place

110
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
The update server let's the user know that there is an update where is the sales service actually where this component

111
00:06:54,207 --> 00:07:00,351
Zip file will be stored on your server so you have something like whmcs

112
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
Or Another

113
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:08,287
Component through which you are selling your extensions you can

114
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:14,431
Use the folder in on your server which it's looking for the files

115
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
You can use that folder you know great in FTP Account to that folder and then set that details 

116
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,623
In this field here

117
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:24,159
And then

118
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:27,487
Component Builder on the moment that you could compile

119
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,559
It has a

120
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:36,959
An option here it says add backup folder and save sales server you click that to

121
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:41,567
Yes and if you compile it now

122
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
It will move

123
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:49,247
The zip file to sales server as well as creating a backup now the backup and the Git 

124
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:55,647
Folder is actually set up in your components Global options so we

125
00:07:55,903 --> 00:08:02,047
We haven't really spoken much about the global options let us open it now here

126
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,191
We saw in this area here

127
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
That it says that this field is encrypted now in component builder if you go to Global

128
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Settings it says

129
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:18,431
Encryption settings in in here

130
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:21,247
You would add a your own key

131
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,575
By which it will encrypt once you've added this key

132
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:29,439
You shouldn't change it because it will obviously not be able to decrypt

133
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,023
Because it's used to encrypt and as well to decrypt

134
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
The data so if you well that just means everything that's been encrypted it is now needs to

135
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:45,823
To be redone which in this case is is gonna be these these login

136
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,407
Information is FTP login information

137
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
That's this is the basic encryption which we spoke of on talk about storing types you got basic encryption

138
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,879
and advanced encryption now this is

139
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
Basic encryption way basically having such a

140
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Is also called basic key

141
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:07,327
Then you have files here or folder paths

142
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:13,727
These two first folder paths called compiler folder and custom folder I would leave them

143
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:20,127
For now they are a little buggy I haven't fully managed to achieve them being

144
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,967
Flexible so to move them at this stage is difficult

145
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,831
For a number of reasons for now I would suggest you just leave them blank

146
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,671
But here you would add a backup folder

147
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:37,279
And this obviously should be related to the root of your server

148
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,047
So

149
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,863
As well as a Git folder

150
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,775
And Git folder would be where component builder creates a folder with all the compounds

151
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,823
Files without zipping them

152
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:55,967
And then you can go to that folder and create a git

153
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
create a git repository there

154
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,575
And from that folder you can push to Github

155
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,623
Or any other git server

156
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:04,671
Respectively

157
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,791
So basically it's able to create a folder from which you can do Github or any other kind of

158
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,327
Repository work

159
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:17,727
Which are separate from your backup folder and also separate from the temporary folder in which

160
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:23,103
compiles the component so you can move it out of your Joomla install basically

161
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,175
And that's what these folder paths are for

162
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
So when you do the compiling of the component it does that git repository it won't delete

163
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:38,975
the Dot git file sorry folder it will just replace all the files in it

164
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:44,607
Basically first remove the old ones then add the new ones and git obviously we'll see that

165
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:51,007
Only the files that is been changed it will notice and those who you need to do a recommit well just obviously a normal commit

166
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:59,967
To get it into your repository obviously if you don't know Git then possibly this then possibly doesn't make sense to you

167
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
There's some great courses as well about Git on lynda.com as well as Udome

168
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:11,743
So you can just go look at those ok so that's a backup folder

169
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:18,143
And the sales server the same goes here this FTP

170
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:24,543
credentials should be that direct folder in which these zip files should be stored

171
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,359
Unfortunately component builder cannot

172
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,759
Storing and subfolders at this point so the FTP details he will just login to that FTP account

173
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
And in that very folder which here is which he has the access to you'll put the file there

174
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:42,975
So no subfolders or

175
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
Other folders the FTP details should be going directly to the folder now

176
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
In the component builder I was thinking just for your own

177
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:02,175
Peace of mind if you look in component builder so

178
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:08,575
That will be in the backend components component builder and then

179
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:14,207
Helpers there is a file called compiler if you open that file

180
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:20,607
You would see that we have a function here built me and here's all the place holders

181
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:26,495
That you can use in the built me file and will be replaced with the relative information

182
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:32,383
And then there is a function here called move file to FTP server

183
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:37,503
This move file to FTP server calls another function called

184
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:44,927
Where is it getFTP now getFTP is this function here

185
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:51,327
And basically it takes the signature checks whether we are ready made such a connection before

186
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,631
And then loads that object

187
00:12:54,143 --> 00:13:00,287
But here basically I'm using this parse string function

188
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
To convert the string into the variables so all the

189
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:11,807
Variables in that string is converted to erase all variables respectively

190
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:18,207
And that then is used to actually make use of

191
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,607
Joomlas own client FTP class so if you wanna know where that is you can

192
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:31,007
NetBeans you'd click control spacebar and it shows you it's in library JclientsFTP

193
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:37,407
.PHP that's where the file is you click there open it

194
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:43,807
So we basically using Joomlas built-in FTP client and we passing the host the port the option the

195
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:49,951
Username the password and making a connection and then we sending that off

196
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:54,815
To do this move file which then basically takes the file content and moves it

197
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,119
To the server

198
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:58,655
So that's just for your own piece of mind that the data itself is not 

199
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
Being leaked or compromised

200
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
It's

201
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,591
So all handled right here and you can 

202
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,127
Follow its events in component builder from

203
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Relations to the update

204
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
Server as well as to the

205
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Sales server

206
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,415
The other thing that I know is quite in

207
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Important

208
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Is this update server

209
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,023
Is an XML file

210
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,071
And this XML file

211
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
is basically build up

212
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:29,887
of versions

213
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
And download links to those versions

214
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
So

215
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,799
Like I explain to you in a previous video

216
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
There is this reality that while you are developing your component

217
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,687
Your users

218
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:45,503
Excuse me wouldn't need

219
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
Any

220
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
change

221
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:48,575
Updates or anything are there

222
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
The moment you put your component out there on the web

223
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,183
Immediately 

224
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
You need to

225
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Consider

226
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
When you make a change in the application

227
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
How will you user to be able adapt 

228
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
to that change

229
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,399
And the biggest changes you can make

230
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
Is adding new views

231
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,471
or adding new

232
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Fields

233
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,287
To the component

234
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:11,103
And so that makes it a little hard

235
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,407
But like I explain previously

236
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,199
With the history component

237
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
We've done scripting to take you know take control of

238
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
That problem

239
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
But

240
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
You also need to think about the database

241
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,159
So we created this thing called

242
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:25,695
Version Updates

243
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
Which

244
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
Gives you the ability

245
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
To actually add sql

246
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,119
Scripting

247
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:35,423
Which needs to be executed upon the updating

248
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,495
Now the way for you to think about this

249
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:41,055
If you have a new version that's a 1.2.9

250
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,943
Then and now you know that there needs to be a table alteration

251
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,503
Obviously you need to know see if MySQL commands

252
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,575
To do that I'm not gonna teach you that you just

253
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:58,975
Need to put that MySQL command in here according to the Joomla conventions which means

254
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:05,375
The table name must have that hash underscore underscore in front of it and Joomla will dynamicaly

255
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:11,775
put in the prefix so you might just simply will do a

256
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:18,175
MySQL script here but if you are making a change and the new releases 1.2.9

257
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:19,967
And

258
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
1.0

259
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Didn't have that

260
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Specific field of view

261
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,135
Then you must realize that

262
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
You're updating this one and so the sql must come next to that specific version

263
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
The update must be placed

264
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
at the version

265
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
Which Needs the update

266
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,703
So if you make it change don't put it here

267
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,471
Because it won't

268
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Update correctly

269
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,287
You need to put the update next

270
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,311
to the Version that needs to be updated

271
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
And then over here

272
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
You would put the link

273
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,199
To the respective

274
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
Downloads

275
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
Ok so

276
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,527
Like here we had

277
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
Version 2.

278
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,319
9

279
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,111
And then we had version 1.3.

280
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,647
0

281
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
And

282
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
We added the 1.3.0 link here

283
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:06,303
Obviously I'm using GitHub as my distributing

284
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,119
Platform of the application

285
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
You could use any URL

286
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
And these URLs is what will be used

287
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
In your updates

288
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,287
Server

289
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,823
So the update server

290
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,871
If I was to open that for us first let me close this and we will go to the update server 

291
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Link copy that 

292
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,975
You'd see that it has this

293
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
URLs here for the download

294
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,327
And as we move on it

295
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
3, 3.1, 3.2

296
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
And so it's getting these

297
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,215
these 

298
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:45,983
Details

299
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,263
It is getting them

300
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,543
From

301
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
This version

302
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:50,847
update area

303
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:54,175
And so the last version in this

304
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:54,943
List being 1.3.

305
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,503
2

306
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:58,783
Must be the same

307
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Is the one that you set here

308
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
That is important

309
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,231
So that it will know ok now we are at the current version

310
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
And it will do the necessary you know the adjustments to that

311
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,167
Ok so that is

312
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:16,191
Basically

313
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
All the concepts that would be

314
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Necessary

315
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
To cover

316
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
Regarding the

317
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Component

318
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Area

319
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
We've looked at adding admin views

320
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,991
We will again look at site views and adding them

321
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
as well as your custom admin views

322
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,623
And we will possibly

323
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Going to more depths 

324
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
about this MySQL tweak

325
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
What we briefly spoke about

326
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,047
But the

327
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,607
For most part that's or the 

328
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
 at Component

329
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Area

330
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
And all it's nice

331
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Features

332
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
Obviously it all stacks upon

333
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,567
each other from the

334
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,615
Fields then the admin

335
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,383
Views and then the components themselves

336
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,503
And if you have come this far

337
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
you Set out your component

338
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
You have added some admin views

339
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
You are now ready to

340
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Start building the front

341
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
and the site area

342
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Which

343
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
You wouldn't be able to

344
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:11,999
To really do effectively until now

345
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,303
It is really necessary to

346
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
First do the admin views

347
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
And then only do the site views

348
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Well Thank you for watching
