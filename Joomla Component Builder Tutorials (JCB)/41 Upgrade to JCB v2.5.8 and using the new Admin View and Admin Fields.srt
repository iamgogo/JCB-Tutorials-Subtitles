00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Hi

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,328
I've got Joomla

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,400
Installed here with

4
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:07,424
JCB

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,216
Joomla component Builder

6
00:00:09,472 --> 00:00:11,520
2.5.6

7
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:14,848
I've got quite a lot of components

8
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,384
That I have

9
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:17,408
Imported

10
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:19,968
From another day JCB

11
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,504
And

12
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,576
Basically all of it is working

13
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:26,880
If we were to look

14
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,672
Inside of them

15
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,744
It really looks the way that it should

16
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,536
And it's expected

17
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,072
Now

18
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
Joomla has

19
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
Conveniently

20
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,192
Decided to

21
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:42,752
Get rid of this repeatable

22
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:43,520
Field

23
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:47,616
Which pops up into a little

24
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:48,896
Model

25
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:50,176
And

26
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:54,272
So we have systemically been removing this field

27
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,320
From JCB

28
00:00:58,624 --> 00:00:59,648
Just to show you

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
We've already done that

30
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:04,256
in other areas of JCB

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,096
Like in the language area

32
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:09,632
If we would to

33
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Open

34
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
Any of these

35
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,496
Language strings

36
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,848
You see that we already have the repeatable field

37
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,640
Set up here

38
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:21,920
Now

39
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:24,992
This would have been a simple as changing the field type

40
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,552
Within JCB to achieve

41
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:28,576
Only

42
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,880
Reality is that the compiler

43
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,000
As well as one other feature which is the Joomla components

44
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,840
Can be exported in JCB packages and imported

45
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,120
And so

46
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:46,240
These features are mapping into these component concepts

47
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
You know the

48
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:51,104
Field structures really how data stored

49
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,384
In a json

50
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,432
By the repeatable fields

51
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:58,272
Are different from how it's being stored in the subform fields

52
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,368
Are gonna go into explaining what the difference is

53
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,648
There is actually

54
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,976
Few tickets been open on GitHub about this

55
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:09,280
And so

56
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
We have

57
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,632
Taken on the task of just Sporting all of this

58
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:19,520
With this next release which is JCB 2.5.8

59
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:22,848
The whole admin View area

60
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,712
Will now be moved over to this new form

61
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:28,992
Subform layout

62
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,832
So if I was to open an admin View now

63
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
It basically has

64
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,160
The old

65
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:38,208
Repeatable field concept

66
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:42,560
As you would have learned with all the tutorials we've done

67
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,400
So your permissions is one of those taps the fields

68
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,960
The conditions the linked fields

69
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,080
And then you have a list of the fields that are linked to the admin View

70
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,176
And you've got some custom buttons you could

71
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,224
Setup and it's also

72
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
A

73
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,552
Repeatable field

74
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,136
As well as linking a sequel

75
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:10,976
Clicking on table this is also repeatable field

76
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,024
In a model

77
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:17,888
So all of these different fields are now gonna be moved to subfields

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,752
Because of space and statistics

79
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:23,776
We will

80
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,336
Move some of these Fields into taps

81
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,712
I will try and do it in a way that seems obvious and that he wouldn't feel lost

82
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,760
So just up front

83
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
The fields

84
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,856
This Fields button

85
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:40,416
Are going to be moved

86
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:43,232
To the fields tab

87
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,560
And so does

88
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:49,120
The conditions move there

89
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:55,776
There will be in new tab called settings so basically this tab will stay there

90
00:03:57,056 --> 00:04:00,384
And will call that details and a new tab with settings

91
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
And the rest of the repeatable fields that are remaining

92
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,760
On this side will be placed there

93
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:09,344
Ok so that's just a heads up on what's gonna happen

94
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:14,720
But this is gonna happen really without you doing much

95
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,047
Basically all you need to do is upgrade

96
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,327
And

97
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,887
We have added a number of scripts

98
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
That you can actually go and look at

99
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:26,239
On GitHub if you like

100
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,311
As I'm doing this recording

101
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,895
The staging branch

102
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,455
Is where you will see these changes

103
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
So

104
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:39,551
Basically if we would to go to the script

105
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:42,367
This is the script that will

106
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,391
Convert

107
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:47,231
The Fields and all the tables and everything

108
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:49,535
So let me just go down to that area

109
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,351
So here we have a function

110
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:55,167
Inside of a method

111
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,983
More like an anonymous function

112
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,263
And

113
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:03,615
Basically this is what converts the repeatable fields

114
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:06,431
So I'll be using this function over and over

115
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
As you can see we've done

116
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:12,575
It with a upgrade to version 2.5.5

117
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
And

118
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:20,255
Then there is another upgrade 2.7 which was not really released because having made this

119
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,279
This change

120
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:24,863
We still need to to convert the repeatable fields

121
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:29,471
And that will continue to run until 2.5.9

122
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:30,751
Now

123
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,543
The way it does this

124
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,079
Is it really

125
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Targets

126
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
The various

127
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Up here

128
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,135
There's to convert repeatable function it Target all these fields

129
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:48,415
as you can see

130
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:50,463
Inside the admin View

131
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:53,791
And it passes it over to this

132
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,583
Convert repeatable

133
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:00,191
Which is really going to do the work and this function

134
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,751
Like I said you can look at it

135
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,031
Over here

136
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,103
If you are uncertain of doing this

137
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:09,407
You can come and look at this function here

138
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,199
And

139
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,807
I will now also demonstrate that it actually does work well

140
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:19,135
The only thing that I have actually noticed

141
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,463
It's like with this website that we are working on here

142
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:26,303
We talking about thousands of values

143
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
Well

144
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Even more than thousands

145
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,143
And

146
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,935
I have found that

147
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,775
It sometimes does not convert every single value

148
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:38,079
And so because of that

149
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,919
We actually did another fix

150
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,199
Which

151
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:48,063
Goes beyond and ensures that this upgrade will not cause any

152
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,111
Internal conflicts

153
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
And that is within the

154
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,439
Backend

155
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:56,767
And within the model

156
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:02,143
There are a few places where these New fields will now exist

157
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,703
One of them is conditions

158
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:09,311
Field conditions and the other one is admin Fields so I'll open that one

159
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
Open this one

160
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,639
And obviously

161
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,919
in a

162
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,687
Oh not

163
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,967
Not that one

164
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,527
It's this admin View

165
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:24,159
These are the models in which these field changes will take place

166
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,975
And you'll see that within the

167
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,767
Get item

168
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,071
Method at the very end

169
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Of this method

170
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
In the admin View

171
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,215
We added a function

172
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,031
Which would basically check

173
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,567
If this

174
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:44,895
These Fields were updated during the upgrade

175
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,199
And if it were not updated

176
00:07:47,455 --> 00:07:52,063
That is while the field is busy loading and you're opening the page

177
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,367
It'll check whether it's been updated

178
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
If it's not updated it will actually make

179
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,463
Do the update

180
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
And add it to the update object

181
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,095
And then basically check every field

182
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,887
All the way down

183
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,167
Till here

184
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:10,495
And then if it sees that there is been any one of those fields

185
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
Found to be

186
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:14,079
You know ready to update

187
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
Then we will run the update

188
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,919
And after that it will never

189
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
Do it again

190
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Because you see the way the

191
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
A the array is constructed

192
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
This

193
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:30,207
Will no longer exist once it's been moved to a subform

194
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,327
Storage

195
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:37,631
The subform array structure is different

196
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:38,911
So

197
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:45,311
Once you open any of the items it will automatically convert it and make sure that it's 

198
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,079
Converted

199
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
The other thing that we've done

200
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:53,503
Because you most probably will not all open every view or every

201
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,039
Admin View

202
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:55,807
Is

203
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:59,647
Even when the new admins Fields we've done the same

204
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:01,183
So you can see here

205
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,535
In the Admin Fields we are also making sure that that update is there

206
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,351
And the same with the Admin field conditions

207
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,911
It's also there

208
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:15,007
But then there is one more place where we also add these

209
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,567
Checks and that's actually in the compiler

210
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,455
So even if you didn't go and open any of these views and you just went straight to the compiler

211
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,527
And try to compile any of your components

212
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,855
The compiler obviously now been adapted

213
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:31,647
to instead

214
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,927
Actually

215
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,487
Use the new subform structure

216
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,791
Within it's compilation

217
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:43,679
To within the get file where most of these subforms are now needed

218
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
We have

219
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
In the get admin

220
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,311
Function let me just get there

221
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
So here is the get admin View

222
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
Method of function class method

223
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:58,015
And you see we are checking

224
00:09:58,527 --> 00:10:01,855
Whether it's still in a repeatable field

225
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:03,135
And if it is

226
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,415
We convert it

227
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,255
And we again store it to the update object

228
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
That

229
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,119
While it's getting this one Admin view at the very end

230
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
So every where it's doing it check

231
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:19,263
If it's not being converted converts it's sets it back to the data set

232
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:23,359
And also to ensure that we store it back into the database

233
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,639
Little String

234
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
And So It Goes On

235
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,479
Doing it everywhere

236
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Where we

237
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,039
You know expect

238
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:33,855
To find values that still

239
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,391
You know me I've been missed

240
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:38,719
And then here it very end of this function

241
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:39,743
Which is a little

242
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
big I supposed

243
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:46,399
If we found that there are any updates we run the update

244
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:52,799
And after that that view is been updated and it will never need to be updated again so these are the

245
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,567
Kind of

246
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:56,383
Switches

247
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,407
How can I put it

248
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
Fixes really

249
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:06,367
That we put in place when you already have a JCB with horrendous amount of

250
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:11,487
Data and it is just too big to do just with the normal install

251
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:14,815
Then all these admin views will

252
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Be

253
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,911
Updated and adapted

254
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:21,471
As you start using JCB

255
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:26,079
And you should not really anywhere at any time experience

256
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Any conflicts

257
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:31,711
In fact if you do the reason for me making this tutorial

258
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,015
Is it you can actually get into the code

259
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,063
And that you can

260
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
You know

261
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Open an issue on GitHub

262
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,927
And give me heads up so I can

263
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,975
You know Patch whatever you find

264
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:45,791
And push it out the rest the community

265
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:50,143
Ok so that was just a code side of things now getting back to

266
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
to our install here

267
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,263
I think what I'll do is I'll

268
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
just open

269
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,127
Maybe this Admin view

270
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,431
And then

271
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
I'm gonna go

272
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,735
And

273
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,015
Basically

274
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,551
Install

275
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,831
The

276
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,111
The upgrade

277
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,231
I'm just gonna selected it's not been released yet

278
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,791
So this is a pre-demostration

279
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,375
Just to ensure everything works

280
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:23,679
So if it doesn't you even see that

281
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,519
So let's just select this file from my computer

282
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,431
Ok there it goes busy installing it

283
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,271
It should take a while it's quite a big dataset

284
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,319
And you can just wait it out

285
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,671
I'd wouldn't shout at you if it missed certain values

286
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,975
I don't know why doesn't but

287
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
there it goes

288
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,791
Your upgrade is been successful

289
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,399
And you are now on version 2.5.8

290
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,727
And if we were to open that Admin view

291
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Which

292
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Basically looked

293
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,543
Like this

294
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
And now just refresh it

295
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
It should now look like that

296
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,503
So you see it's moved

297
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:11,295
These Fields to the side

298
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
There's now a settings field

299
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:19,231
And as you can see all the data is just been updated and moved to subform

300
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,511
 values

301
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,815
Same with the taps

302
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,887
And if we go to field and conditions

303
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
There we go

304
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,983
That's how the new field and conditions view looks like

305
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:31,775
Now

306
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:37,919
Because of many reasons we couldn't keep the subform fields within the admin View

307
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
Especially when you

308
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
Start having

309
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:41,503
More than 

310
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:48,927
50 admin Fields which in my case I have quite a few of those it's not advisable

311
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,255
Because it actually causes the tremendous

312
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
Slow down on page load I mean imagine each of these lines are actually 1 2 3 4 

313
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,935
5 6 7

314
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
8 9 10 11 12 13 fields

315
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
And if you start having a huge a lot of those fields

316
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:09,151
Which you could have up to 800

317
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:14,783
By the limit we've set it really takes a long time to load that into the page

318
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Ok

319
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,367
Enough about that how does it work now

320
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:21,695
Well you could either click on this edit button here

321
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:27,583
Or this edit button here to actually go and edit these and change their values

322
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,679
If you would like to just edit one specific field

323
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
You could click on any of these

324
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
you know pencil editing

325
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:38,079
Links

326
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,895
So for example if I click on name

327
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:46,015
It will ask me whether I've saved all my values in this current View

328
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
And yes I just click ok

329
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:50,879
And it will now open the name field

330
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,207
And I can now come in here do any edits that I'd like

331
00:14:54,719 --> 00:15:00,095
And then save and close or just close out again if you wanna only wanna get some information

332
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:01,631
Now

333
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,911
Back into

334
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:03,935
This area

335
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:09,311
The same goes with the custom Fields I could click on any of those to edit them

336
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,127
Or I could click on this edit here

337
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,151
And it will

338
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
again ask me if I saved all my work

339
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:17,503
And then if I did

340
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,783
click ok

341
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,063
And opens

342
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
Those values right here

343
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:27,487
A nice new tweak with added is that it only loads the fields

344
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,047
That are actually linked to this Admin view

345
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,095
So that you can only Target

346
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,887
The specific fields

347
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,679
Which really makes sense

348
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
That

349
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,775
Those are the fields that needs to be targeted

350
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
With this conditional option

351
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,431
Then you could also create a field but creating a field will not

352
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,759
Necessarily add it to the admin View

353
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,319
It will just make it available to you

354
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
If you were to have

355
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
You know add it

356
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
By going to admin fields

357
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,767
Oh yes let me just say this this button here

358
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,559
And this one here is the same button

359
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,351
Just this is a shortcut

360
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:07,423
Because sometimes you might have a lot of fields

361
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:10,239
And it's a way down there to get to conditions

362
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
So we added some shortcuts up here

363
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:15,359
There's also the tutorial

364
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:20,479
On how to use this but the tutorial still was made when we had the old Fields layout

365
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,343
It should still make sense I mean you just need to keep in mind that things change a little

366
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,647
So you could click here

367
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
On any of these links

368
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:30,975
To actually open

369
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:33,535
That area where the fields are now found

370
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,583
And make the changes

371
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:40,959
So that's really the new admin Fields and

372
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:43,775
moving away from repeatable fields

373
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
To start using subforms for all our

374
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,639
Repeatable concepts

375
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,687
It's really what

376
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,991
This upgrade is all about

377
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:58,111
There is 1 heads up which I know is little different to how things were done previously

378
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,183
Let me just close out of this

379
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,463
Admin View

380
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,255
Oh yes

381
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,791
I could just mention this

382
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:12,447
Here is a shortcut to get to the admin Fields without opening the admin view and then opening the admin fields

383
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,751
You can click on this right here

384
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
and it will automatically take you

385
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
to the admin fields

386
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,663
And you can make changes here

387
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,711
And obviously it's link to the look

388
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,479
Area

389
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,783
or the look admin view

390
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:30,367
And the same is true when looking at

391
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,719
The conditions there the second button here is for conditions

392
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,351
The thing that has changed is if you create a new admin View

393
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Now

394
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:47,519
You would obviously add the single record name the list record name the short description

395
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,055
And the system name

396
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:51,359
And that's really all you need to add

397
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:56,223
To save the admin view for the first time because

398
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
The admin view at this stage

399
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
It cannot be linked

400
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
to any Fields until it has an ID

401
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,439
Now I might still work on this and try and

402
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
You know

403
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
Tune it in a way that

404
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,095
When you click the button and if the

405
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:14,911
Admin view is not saved it saves it for you

406
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
But

407
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,495
I haven't done that yet so at this stage

408
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
Since the admin field doesn't have an ID it's still new because we haven't clicked save

409
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
Even once

410
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
You can't link any Fields to them

411
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,319
To it so what you would

412
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,367
Natural do is just add some

413
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Add some name here

414
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,511
And

415
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,959
And then just save it once

416
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:57,151
And having done that if you now go to Fields and conditions

417
00:18:57,407 --> 00:18:58,943
It basically says create

418
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,527
To this button here and that one here is the same button

419
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,855
You can click on any of them to create fields

420
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,647
So if you would create a field

421
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,695
So yes I did save everything

422
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
And then

423
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:12,767
I

424
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,327
You can just click on this plus over here

425
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,167
And there's a first field and you can start you know adding fields

426
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,983
And tweak them as you would before

427
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
And

428
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Yep so there you go

429
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
That's the new subform

430
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,663
Fields for admin views

431
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,503
And that's what this upgrade is really all about

432
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,855
I trust that it all benefit all of us in the future

433
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,719
And make it more easier for us to transition into Joomla 4

434
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,255
And thank you for watching.
