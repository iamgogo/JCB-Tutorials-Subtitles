1
00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:02,560
I would like to

2
00:00:03,072 --> 00:00:07,424
Introduce you to a feature that we've been working on for quite some time now

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:11,776
And I'm very sure it will

4
00:00:12,032 --> 00:00:15,360
Come as a surprise to some of you that actually can do this

5
00:00:17,664 --> 00:00:19,968
Most of the features already existed

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,504
For quite a while

7
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:24,064
It's just that

8
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,112
I've been

9
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
Trying to make it

10
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:29,696
Stable so that

11
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,488
It will work well

12
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:35,328
And in doing so I had to extend it a bit

13
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:36,864
So I wanna

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
I wanna look at this feature

15
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:40,704
It actually has three

16
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,080
Two or three concepts which maybe is best if I explain that

17
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,128
So what is this all about

18
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:49,408
Ok

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,200
It's about adding

20
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
Dynamic

21
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,272
Files

22
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,064
Folders

23
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:58,624
Or even external

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,208
Files

25
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,280
Which maybe is on a website

26
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Or

27
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,840
On GitHub

28
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,400
And you want to

29
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,216
Get the content from that file and add it

30
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,752
Maybe as code

31
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:17,312
Or even as a file

32
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,336
To your

33
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:19,616
system

34
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:21,408
So

35
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:22,944
Here's the thing

36
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:28,064
I'm working with components that is pulling data from all over the place

37
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:29,856
And so

38
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,208
Most of these features are really what what I've been needing to

39
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,744
Get projects going

40
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
And

41
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Trying to save myself

42
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,352
Time

43
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,632
That I don't need to

44
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:47,776
Copy paste and move things around to ensure that it's a correct copy being used and on compilation

45
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
And JCB itself is maybe one of the best

46
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:52,896
Explanations

47
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
So let's look at this

48
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:57,760
You know that there is a feature

49
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
But you can add files

50
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
And folders

51
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:03,136
This feature is like I said it's always been there

52
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,928
But currently

53
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
I have expanded this

54
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:10,048
By adding an advanced tab to this feature

55
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,376
It's got this basic which is the normal one

56
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:17,216
Which if you watched some of the previous tutorials the older tutorials

57
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:19,008
I do actually explain

58
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:20,800
How this works

59
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,872
And how you get these files and I'm not gonna go into that

60
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,712
There is now a new area called advance

61
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:35,392
Sorry I had to just quickly update that note for us

62
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,696
Advance area now

63
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:39,232
Is able to

64
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,000
Grab

65
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:43,072
Files from anywhere in your system

66
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:45,120
An added to the component

67
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Now

68
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:49,728
It can be files outside of the root

69
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Directory of your Joomla website

70
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Just being sure

71
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,104
That

72
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,384
The PHP

73
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Which usually is a php has permission

74
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:03,552
Has the right to the file and can read it

75
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,112
So this is just the only thing

76
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
But for most cases

77
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
We won't need to grab files outside of the Joomla root directory because we actually

78
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,632
Maybe just editing a custom script

79
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,424
Custom file

80
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
Inside of our Joomla

81
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,288
Component which we've created

82
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,336
But this file or

83
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:28,128
This folders are not

84
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,432
Generated by JCB

85
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
So we want those files

86
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,832
Where they are actively running inside of our component

87
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,880
We want them to be

88
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:44,256
Basically taken and put into the package without us having to move it around

89
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,816
That's what this featuring will now do

90
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:50,144
So you can like a I'm doing here

91
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,448
I you can use constants

92
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,264
You'll see there's a little note here that tells you that

93
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
That you can use constant paths and the full path

94
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:02,432
Directly without quotes that means

95
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,968
You don't need to do

96
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:08,064
You know like in PHP you know you do something like that wait no not

97
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,416
And you put this part in quotes right like that

98
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
Well you don't need to do any of that

99
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:17,024
You put the constant directly

100
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,815
Like that and

101
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
The compiler will deal with this

102
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,143
And make it right

103
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:23,679
So

104
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,519
That you can do also with folders as well as with files

105
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:29,055
And then

106
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:32,639
You obviously need to still set the target path and relation

107
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
To the ZIP package

108
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
So you have folders

109
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,271
Called admin

110
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:42,111
But as you can see here I'm actually doing

111
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,671
A folder called libraries

112
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
And

113
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,023
That means I am targeting a

114
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,607
A folder which isn't actually

115
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:56,191
Usually part of a package

116
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:58,239
you know a component package

117
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:04,127
But because I want that folder to be installed with my component every time

118
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,455
And I don't want to do actually have a separate

119
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,247
A package for

120
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
For this library

121
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
I've actually

122
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,463
Improved JCB to include this

123
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Package

124
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:23,583
Which is basically if you guys go look at this

125
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:26,399
You see that is It's basically a

126
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,679
Composer

127
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,751
file and I'm including some

128
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,287
Composer

129
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:35,615
Classes there which we are now using in JCB

130
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
And I'm moving it

131
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
Every time with each install

132
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,735
Into its place

133
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Now

134
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,807
That might be

135
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,367
I'll sort of convention I suppose

136
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:50,719
But there is neither rules against it I think in

137
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,743
Yeah so

138
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,023
That's what we're doing

139
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:59,423
What's nice though is that when JCB detects that you are not targeting the normal Admin

140
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,703
Or

141
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,495
Media

142
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:03,519
Or

143
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,311
Image folder or site

144
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
Those are the normal folders

145
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,151
Then

146
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
oh wait not

147
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,735
Image folder is neither is that normal

148
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:19,391
But did you got your three that is site admin and Media If If JCB detects you're

149
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,439
gonna be moving content

150
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:23,999
Into a folder that's not part of the

151
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,095
Expected package component package folders

152
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,167
It will actually add a little script

153
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,727
To the script install

154
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:38,079
So that it all move this folder into its correct place

155
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,407
On upon installation of the component

156
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Or whether the component is updated

157
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,271
So you can go look at that

158
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:48,831
In fact I can show you just briefly

159
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,159
So here I got the component open

160
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,487
The Script file for component Builder

161
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:58,303
I'm gonna scroll down it's obviously a huge file

162
00:06:58,559 --> 00:07:01,375
But here at the bottom we know have this new little script

163
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:07,263
It's named a little weird so it doesn't conflict with any other method in it at anytime

164
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,823
And basically

165
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,615
It gets the

166
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,431
The details from the above methods

167
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
And then it checks whether

168
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:22,111
The folders obviously it gets there the dynamic install folder

169
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:26,719
It checks whether there is more than one

170
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:27,999
And

171
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Then

172
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:29,791
If it's

173
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:36,191
One of these it ignores it because those already being deal dealt with by Joomla

174
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,007
And if it isn't

175
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:42,079
It actually moves it into it's correct place

176
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,407
Now this is a dangerous featuring

177
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:51,039
As you can see here I'm saying you must use this with caution because you can literally

178
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Grab

179
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
With this new function

180
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:54,879
Any

181
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:58,719
Thing anywhere from your Joomla website and overwrite

182
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:00,511
It anywhere

183
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
On the

184
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,351
Users installation website

185
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
Which could be problematic

186
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
And

187
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Something you shouldn't do

188
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Unless you are

189
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
You know unless it is your right to do so

190
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:22,783
Ok so this is the new feature in in doing dynamic

191
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,575
Movement of folders

192
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
And files

193
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:33,535
What's make this all so nice if you're using these constants in your naming of your paths

194
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:39,423
And you export and import this component into another Joomla website

195
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,703
Then

196
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,519
I mean as a JCB package right

197
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:49,151
If you export a JCB package and you imported at another JCB install

198
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:54,271
It actually remaps these files it actually export them

199
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,879
Remaps them and move them back into place on the other install

200
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Which

201
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,559
Really makes it very comfortable in you know working in a team and you wanna have these

202
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
Is files always be the same everywhere

203
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,959
This is so gonna be very helpful for that

204
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,751
I can also

205
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,311
Obviously because of the feature

206
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
I give you the heads Up

207
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,895
But if you import a package

208
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,175
From anyone

209
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,783
And and you do not know or you do not trust them

210
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:29,087
they could actually move files

211
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
Through this method into your system

212
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,511
And is therefore part of first security which you need to consider

213
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:39,583
With whom you are sharing packages

214
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:40,863
Anyway

215
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
So this is so some of the

216
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:48,799
Feature regarding the new folder implementation folder and file implementation

217
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:51,871
The other aspect which I mentioned earlier

218
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,455
Were you actually able to get content from anywhere

219
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,759
Works as follow

220
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,135
So anywhere in any custom area of JCB

221
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
Where you can actually add custom script

222
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:09,535
You can also now used to this external code

223
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
Snippet

224
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:13,375
Now this could be a URL

225
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,751
Or it could be a folder inside of your system

226
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,847
This folder does not yet work with

227
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
With Constance I should actually make it that it does

228
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:30,527
And it actually needs to be the exact for the path of the stage

229
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:34,111
But the reality is that with this external code

230
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Concept

231
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:36,671
You can take

232
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,951
For example

233
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
variable

234
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
From a

235
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,399
Gits snippet let me let me show you

236
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,215
So here I have what

237
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
I've called fancy date

238
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:55,615
Which is basically a few functions static functions

239
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:01,759
Which are not wrapped in the class yet so it's basically outside of a class

240
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,087
And why because I want to include it

241
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,879
Into my

242
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,159
Helper class

243
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
With the snippet

244
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:11,487
So

245
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:16,607
That I can have others work with me on this code on GitHub

246
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
And

247
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:24,287
If any changes be made to this code it automatically updates my system

248
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,407
Now I know that there is some question of security in doing so

249
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
But we've added a few little

250
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
Tricks in the compiler

251
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,807
They actually notify you

252
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,855
If there's been a change to the code

253
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:43,231
So what that means is the first time you use that snippet

254
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,535
To include this

255
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
Snippet that you've got here

256
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,887
You obviously do something like

257
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:50,911
Raw

258
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,775
And then here I have basically a text file

259
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
So you'd grab that URL

260
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:05,247
An add it like this

261
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,367
You can take away

262
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,951
The actual because currently

263
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
It is bound to a specific version

264
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,303
Which obviously

265
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:20,863
If anybody makes a change to the snippet

266
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
You won't get the new version

267
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,215
Well that's the way of locking it in

268
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,335
But if you wanted to have it be Dynamic you can actually remove a part of this

269
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:31,871
I think it's this part

270
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:32,895
Let me just check

271
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
Yeah that's right

272
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:37,247
Then you can use it like that

273
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:42,367
Now this specific piece of text that you see here

274
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:45,439
Will dynamically be added to my component

275
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,719
Let me demonstrate

276
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,303
So here I've opened component Builder

277
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:51,839
in it's back end

278
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:57,471
I'm gonna scroll I've gone to this libs and helpers tab I'm gonna scroll down

279
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
To this area which is called

280
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:05,663
Admin class so I just do in the admin area so that's easily

281
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,199
Detectable

282
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:11,807
I'm gonna add that snippet like that so it says external code

283
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,111
With the path of the URL

284
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:15,903
And

285
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:18,207
That's it I'm gonna save and close

286
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
Then let's go to the compiler

287
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,887
Now what should happen

288
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,983
Is that the moment you've compiled this it should tell you

289
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,775
That you've added

290
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
This kind of external code to your component

291
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:42,783
If it doesn't tell you that then something's wrong it should tell you the first time you've add the snippet

292
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:45,343
Because it actually creates a hash

293
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,879
Of that snippet

294
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:51,487
So that in the future if it changes

295
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
You get notified

296
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
So when we grab the snippet from

297
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:56,863
Github

298
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,703
An anybody in the middle you know tampers with it

299
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
It will notify you that the snippet was changed now if you know that it should have changed because

300
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,943
You made a change to the gits

301
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:14,527
you know snippet or someone else in your team did

302
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,831
That obviously you'll be expecting that

303
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:21,951
But you could still for safety sake go check in the code of the component

304
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:26,559
Where the snippet is being added to ensure that it is actually still accurate

305
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
So I'll show you that

306
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
Let's compile this

307
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:38,847
So we see two messages that are relevant to the issue at hand

308
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,711
This one is a new message which I'm not gonna go into now

309
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,271
But it's basically dealing with that

310
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,575
That is actually detected

311
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,111
That

312
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,927
Remember we said we have this folder we

313
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
Pulling inside of the

314
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
Library folders

315
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,327
And Everytime You'd compile

316
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,863
You actually tell you that

317
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,143
You tell you

318
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:06,495
That it is detected it and it's added The Script to the script

319
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
PHP

320
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
So

321
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:11,103
Yeah I wasn't gonna explain it I did

322
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,943
Anyway so that's what that is about but this first line here

323
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,759
Is showing you the snippet

324
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:21,087
And it's telling you there's been added for the first time

325
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:26,719
And that you should be investigate to insure the correct code string was used

326
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
So you should go

327
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:33,119
To the place where in JCB the sorry in the package

328
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:37,471
The compile package where this should have been added

329
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
Go and check that it is the correct

330
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,847
That what you see here on GitHub

331
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
The string here

332
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:47,455
Is also what you gonna see in the code

333
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,271
That's the first thing

334
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,903
Every time there after it should give you this little message here

335
00:15:56,671 --> 00:16:02,303
And it should tell you how many code strings are being added to this component as an external code

336
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
And to avoid shipping your component with malicious code string always make sure that the correct code string values

337
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Were used

338
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:15,871
Now I did tell you that if we did take the change it will also notify you so

339
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:18,431
First let's go do what it said here

340
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,735
Let's go check that it is to correct code

341
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,087
Because I'm in the ZIP package

342
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,183
So we see that this the library folder been added

343
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:34,047
we gonna go to the admin area helpers and then open

344
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,607
Component Builders helper

345
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,935
File which is where I added the snippet right

346
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,727
So let's just open that

347
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:44,799
And then

348
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,823
Here we have it

349
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,639
fancy date

350
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:51,455
And fancy datetime

351
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:52,479
So

352
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,295
Basically from here

353
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,087
To here

354
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,927
Was taken from GitHub and put inside of the component

355
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,511
Now I'm gonna go make it change to the snippet

356
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:05,791
on GitHub

357
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,607
I'm gonna just do something small

358
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:13,215
So that we can see what happens if it change is made

359
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,751
To this code

360
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
And how JCB response

361
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,871
I'm just adding this

362
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,943
New little string here saying change was made

363
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:26,015
And I'm updating this public

364
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:26,783
Gist

365
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:32,415
So it now tells us that it's been revised for a second time

366
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,207
And a change was made

367
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:41,119
Now let's compile the component without doing anything else just make the changes here on GitHub

368
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,935
Then go back to the component and compile it

369
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,495
So here we are

370
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
Selecting version

371
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:48,799
Compile

372
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:55,199
I can see I will have the maybe add some space in between the messages here

373
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,015
Doesn't always seem clear enough

374
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,599
That the messages are not related to each other like

375
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:05,439
Here it's showing that other message again like it said it would

376
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,255
But you might miss that

377
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
So

378
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:11,839
I think I'll have to look at that anyway

379
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
Here in the warnings area

380
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
We see this

381
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:17,983
We see that

382
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
It has changed

383
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,335
Since the last compilation

384
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
Please investigate

385
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
To ensure that changes safe

386
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
That means

387
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,551
JCB is automatically detected

388
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:36,927
That the snippet that you originally added has actually been updated

389
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,767
At this point we anticipated that so

390
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,815
If we go and look at the code

391
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:48,959
We see that it just added this little part here the change was made

392
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:53,055
And the rest of it is exactly the way we want that

393
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,103
And so everything is fine

394
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,151
It's a change we anticipated

395
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:00,735
So we know that nobody else has tampered with the script

396
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,319
And neither was there a man in the middle attack

397
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:06,111
An in any case

398
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,927
If there is someone tampering with the script

399
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:12,255
It will end up as a string here

400
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:15,327
So let's say they put something in here it will

401
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
it'll do

402
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,911
Something like that whatever they put in

403
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
And you will see this error

404
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
In your file

405
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
So that's

406
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:27,359
Basically how it will play out

407
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:33,247
But in the actual reality JCB will detect that

408
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,599
It will see that the hash for the script is changed

409
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,671
And it will notify you with that message

410
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:46,815
I'm gonna do my part and trying to make sure that it's more obvious you won't miss that message

411
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:51,679
But that anyway when you use this kind of implementation

412
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:58,335
It is not the most ideal implementation it's just that sometimes we want included an

413
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
external value in our component

414
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,687
Which is dynamically changing

415
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
And

416
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
And we wanna do it without really thinking about all the time

417
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,367
And this is what this feature is ideal for

418
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,183
I'm so use it with caution and

419
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:15,231
You know know what you doing

420
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:17,535
Or don't use it at all

421
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,631
So that was a quick overview

422
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
Of the new

423
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,959
Folder file

424
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Inclusion

425
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,799
As well external code

426
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,591
Inclusion

427
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:36,223
Features which I really trust would be useful to you

428
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:40,319
It's powerful tools so I realize

429
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:43,903
There are the danger of it being abused

430
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
But at the same time

431
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
I think component development works upon reputation and if you wanna have a good 

432
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,679
reputation in the community

433
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,263
You shouldn't do anything that will hurt others

434
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,567
Or damage their

435
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:03,359
Contribution

436
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:05,663
And their applications

437
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:07,455
but you should steer

438
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:10,271
Within the parameters of your own component

439
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
And your own implementation and any case because people are gonna look at your code they are gonna 

440
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:19,232
unzip your package they are gonna see

441
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
If you're doing things that are not

442
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:27,936
You no good they're gonna notice that and your reputation will get hurt

443
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:30,496
And that's the last thing you would want

444
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,824
When you're developing components for Joomla

445
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,640
Anyway thank you for watching
