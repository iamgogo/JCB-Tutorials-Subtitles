00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi

2
00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:08,192
I would like to demonstrate to you the new automated backup feature that's been added to JCB

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,288
It is part of a

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:15,104
Extension

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,664
Which I called the API

6
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,992
Which really gives you the option of

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,296
Querying JCB

8
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:25,344
Via a URL

9
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:28,160
To perform certain functions

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
First of which would be to actually generate a backup

11
00:00:33,536 --> 00:00:35,584
We not sure exactly

12
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,424
What kind of features we should be adding to this API

13
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,496
And we started to discussion

14
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,288
About this on GitHub and

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:45,824
You're welcome to

16
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,384
Give me a shout

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
Just send me an email you can

18
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,200
Just check here

19
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:52,736
My email address is

20
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
Behind this link here

21
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:00,416
Features we want to add to the API

22
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:05,536
Currently the first one like I said is the backup feature

23
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,304
Now

24
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,864
JCB already

25
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,680
Has in its

26
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,728
Component area

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,336
An export component feature which we basically just extended

28
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:19,360
To automate

29
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
But we've left it as well

30
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:27,296
Here is a button called backup and it actually is the same feature except

31
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:30,624
You can now manually also trigger that feature

32
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
Now what this backup feature does

33
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:36,256
Either being triggered by a

34
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,840
A CronJob or being triggered by this button

35
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Is it actually

36
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,192
Takes all your components

37
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:44,960
And

38
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,264
Exports them

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,544
Encrypts stem

40
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,360
Stores them on a local folder

41
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,920
And emails the key to a

42
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
Trusted email address

43
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
Would you have set up

44
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:58,784
Now

45
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
The

46
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,928
Components that are in your trash will not be

47
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:07,488
Actually part of this backup

48
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,304
So only components that are published

49
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:13,376
Or unpublished or archived

50
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,728
Will be in the backup every everything else will be ignored

51
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
And

52
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,152
Basically when the backup runs either manually or automated via

53
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
A CronJob

54
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,736
It will take those components

55
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:34,112
Use the specific keys as it would with an exporting of a components

56
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,904
An encrypted

57
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
And

58
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,976
Store them in that folder as I said

59
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512
Now

60
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:43,072
There are some things you need to set up

61
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:44,608
For all  this to work

62
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
As expected

63
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,520
The first of these being in the options area of JCB there are some new

64
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:54,080
Feature so let's just open that

65
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,944
So we see there is now a mail configuration

66
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,736
at DKIM

67
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
And a CronJob

68
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:08,672
Tab it added and also this field here called API user

69
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:11,488
Maybe let me start with this field

70
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
The API user

71
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,328
 Primarily be used

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,608
for

73
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,936
The ID that is used

74
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,240
In the permission structure

75
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,008
You see

76
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,568
When you are in the components area

77
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,640
And you trigger this feature manually

78
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,224
It actually uses this current login user

79
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
To determine whether that

80
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,880
The components being you know encrypted and backed up

81
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:41,696
Whether he has the permission to actually

82
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,464
Do that

83
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
Now

84
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,280
This a way

85
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:49,376
As we increase the permission structure of JCB

86
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:56,032
You might end up having components that certain individuals who are in certain groups may not have access

87
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:56,800
to them

88
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:02,944
And then there might be components and Fields and views that they may have access to

89
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,760
Or some that they may not have access to

90
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,320
And so we're already now

91
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,672
Laying some of the foundation to make sure that there isn't some loophole

92
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,464
Where are there by

93
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
Triggering a bash sorry a batch

94
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,351
Update or export of components or backup

95
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:25,983
They can't extrude certain components which they actually by Default don't have access to

96
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,055
I know that's a long explanation but

97
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:35,967
 It's that's just to give you a background to why we still need an API user

98
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,015
We still need a user

99
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:41,343
Which now if it's automated the backup

100
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
That this user ID actually

101
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,207
Allows him to make the backup

102
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:49,023
So that means that the IP sorry

103
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:52,095
The API user should be a user

104
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,399
Which has the permission

105
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:58,495
To all the actual components Fields and

106
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,287
Well everything actually

107
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,591
In the JCB component

108
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,127
Now

109
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:07,711
It is secure because like I said the component

110
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:10,015
Gets

111
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
Compiled

112
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,343
And stored locally

113
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,367
We might

114
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
Consider adding

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:20,255
The option to push the component backup to an FTP

116
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,535
Server

117
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,863
But that part is not fully functional yet

118
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
We we have had

119
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,447
the

120
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:34,335
The proposals made to do that so that the backup is actually not even on the same system

121
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:38,175
But did it secure on another system so if this system

122
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,199
Collapses

123
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,503
You you still safe

124
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,551
You still got you your data out

125
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
So that sounds to me as a good

126
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:51,231
Idea and so we will be adding an FTP

127
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,511
Option as well

128
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,607
Which will very much for the work similar as your components

129
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,727
When you compile a component and it sends it off to a sale server or

130
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
Or such

131
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:08,639
That is really the same features will make use of anyway so

132
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,687
That's just talking about

133
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,991
Selecting an API user

134
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:15,551
And why that is important

135
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,831
Now

136
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:18,879
When we go to the CronJob

137
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Tab

138
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,975
We will see that there is some is basic instructions here

139
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,399
For those of you familiar with CronJobs I suppose there everything is self explanatory

140
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,751
Those who are not I would suggest you Google around

141
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Find some tutorials

142
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,311
Read up

143
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,359
Make sure you know what you're doing

144
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223
And that you're a very comfortable and setting up a CronJob

145
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,575
There are various ways for you to trigger this URL

146
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:54,975
The system currently detects whether your system actually can run curl request

147
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:59,071
And if it can't it will fall back on the getoption

148
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
Assuming that JCB is installed

149
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:07,007
In an environment that allows these two functions to work

150
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,567
If not you can simply take

151
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,103
Only the URL

152
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:13,407
And run it in a CronJob

153
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,967
In in the manner that is

154
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
You know applicable to your system

155
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,831
And know that

156
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:24,159
This URL actually just triggers

157
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
The backup to start

158
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,999
And when the backups finished

159
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,047
It actually just tells you

160
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,095
The same message that you will get

161
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,679
If you run the backup by clicking backup here

162
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,495
You see there is a green message that pops up

163
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,823
Saying yes the backup was done the email was sent

164
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
Those are the only messages

165
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,407
That also actually

166
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:50,271
Gets returned upon this URL

167
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:53,087
So they they are the same

168
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,111
Now

169
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,927
We currently throwing that responds away

170
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
But you could

171
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Add it to a log

172
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:03,071
Depending on how regularly this CronJobs running

173
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:06,143
There isn't the date currently I think

174
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
It might make sense for us to add a date

175
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,263
But at this stage there isn't one

176
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:18,175
Ok so now we if you're running in a firewall your Joomla website has a firewall installed

177
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,479
like RS firewall

178
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:23,551
Then you you might need to adapt your

179
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Your curl request

180
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,135
To behave like a real browser

181
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:33,535
And here is a a a a post on stackoverflow that could actually help you

182
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:35,583
Understand more about that

183
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:38,399
So now currently the

184
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
Cron backup folder path is set

185
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,239
Here

186
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:45,823
And so it currently only backups to a local folder

187
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,407
As I said we will add an FTP option here

188
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,295
We will still work out how we can do that and still have it secure

189
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:58,111
Joomla doesn't by Default actually

190
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
Encrypt fields in the

191
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,999
You know Global configuration of your component

192
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:05,279
And

193
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,655
So that's might be part of what makes it difficult for us to implement This

194
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,935
Here but

195
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
But we will work on that

196
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:17,567
The point is currently It stores it into a local folder

197
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,103
And it

198
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:23,711
Emails the backup key to the email address that you set in here

199
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:27,551
Now make sure that email address is secure

200
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:30,111
And that it is safe

201
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:33,695
Obviously because the keys are being sent to it

202
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:38,303
Now here is a naming structure for your file

203
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:44,703
By Default it actually adds only up till the day so it will

204
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:49,311
Make backups all through the day but overwrite the file every time

205
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:53,919
Unless you add an hour then it'll only per hour overwrite it

206
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:55,455
And if you add a minute

207
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,551
It will actually never overwrite it because it will be a different minute every time

208
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,367
So that is

209
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:07,487
To rename your package and to see how much of the backups you want to

210
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
Keep

211
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
And

212
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:20,031
If we go to the mail configuration area you see that it currently set to use the global Mail

213
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,591
Configuration which is your Joomla default

214
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:23,871
Now

215
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,527
I would advise that you use a very secure method of sending

216
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:31,551
the emails

217
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,135
So either SMTP

218
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,463
overwriting the SMTP settings here

219
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,095
Or if you use the global ones then overwrite or insured at your Global

220
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:47,679
Email settings in Joomla is also using SMTP

221
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,543
That it actually runs through an SSL and is secure

222
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,431
Ok the DKIM is also a added feature

223
00:10:58,687 --> 00:11:00,479
Which can increase

224
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:01,759
Trust

225
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
And security

226
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,831
Off your emails

227
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:09,951
Then there is the folder sorry the company

228
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:10,975
Details

229
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Which

230
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,535
At this stage

231
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
Is important

232
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:19,935
To add since it will also become part of the backup package

233
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:26,591
And we will look at that again when we restore a backup to show you where this information comes up

234
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,943
Ok so that some of the settings you need to first set

235
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,247
Within your Global configuration

236
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
Now once you've set those settings

237
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
Company settings your CronJob settings

238
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:42,207
Your local path the email the name

239
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
And your

240
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
User

241
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,327
API user

242
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,911
You can save and close this area

243
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
And we can start looking at a component

244
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,543
See this feature in action

245
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,151
Now since this is a default Joomla website

246
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,687
Sorry Joomla

247
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:05,247
Install and JCB install

248
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
There's only one component here

249
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,623
And it's the demo component

250
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,951
Now usually the demo component doesn't have

251
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
Encryption key

252
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,279
So I'll open it

253
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,047
And

254
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,863
I've already set it because I've done this video

255
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:21,887
A few times

256
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
So

257
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:28,287
You basically come and set an export key

258
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,847
In at least one of the components

259
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
That will be part of the backup

260
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:35,199
If any one of the components

261
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:37,759
That are being backup have an export key

262
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:41,343
It will actually encrypt all the components with that export key

263
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:46,975
If multiple one's have an export key it will Combine those keys

264
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
To use as the encryption key

265
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,399
It hashes those keys so the actual key is not what is actually being used

266
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:58,751
And the actual key that's being used is the one that will be emailed out

267
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,799
To do that trusted email address

268
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,127
So we'll save and close the the demo component

269
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:05,407
And

270
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Then

271
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,783
We will just run a manual backup here

272
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
Which like I explained before is really similar to the CronJob except that it's triggered by clicking

273
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
This button

274
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
Ok so we just click it there

275
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:21,791
And

276
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,095
The moment since it's a very

277
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Just one component

278
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
It's not a very big

279
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
Process it should

280
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:30,495
be finished quite quickly

281
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,311
And it will basically say ok

282
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,847
The backup has been

283
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
Done successfully

284
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,735
The owner details was set so if for some reason you forgot

285
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,855
To set the owner details in the options area it will actually tell you that here

286
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:48,159
And the email

287
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:50,207
With the new key was sent

288
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:51,999
So now

289
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:55,071
To make sure that your backup actually works

290
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,631
You should now go check the folder

291
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,447
In which you set The Backup should be placed

292
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,007
And see whether the backup is there

293
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,311
And also

294
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:09,919
Check the email address and see whether that they receive the key

295
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,479
So I'll be doing that quickly

296
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:19,135
Ok I see I have a backup actually here in the folder

297
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
As expected

298
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,207
So the backups been done

299
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,279
I can double click into the backup

300
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,351
And make sure that it has all the

301
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,399
Expected files

302
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:35,263
And at this stage it looks It Like It does if you have a lot of custom

303
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
Files

304
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
That you've added into the component

305
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,687
There will also be an extra custom

306
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Folder in the zip

307
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,247
Document

308
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,551
And I not only in image one

309
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,159
Ok so we will test this backup by actually importing it

310
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:55,743
But first let's see if we received the email as well

311
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:01,631
So here we can see that it also send the email as expected

312
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,191
With the corresponding key

313
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,007
Will be using this key to test the backup

314
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,871
Be sure again like I said that it actually sends the key

315
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,151
to a secure

316
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,711
Website email address

317
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,759
And that

318
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,527
That

319
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,855
That even the email that sense

320
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,623
The

321
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:24,927
Email from Joomla

322
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:28,255
Is using a secure SSL by SMPT

323
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:32,607
Now let's test this backup

324
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:40,287
A backup will only makes sense if we actually lost our data so I'm gonna take

325
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:43,103
the component

326
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,943
And basically

327
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:50,527
Wipe this one just delete it

328
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,831
Throw that in trash

329
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:57,439
Then go to trash

330
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
and

331
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
Empty the trash

332
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,351
So know

333
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
There is no components

334
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:12,031
Click on import components

335
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,639
Now we need to browse to the directory

336
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,991
Where that component was backed up so we'll click on the directory tab

337
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,599
So there we have the components

338
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
The path to the actual backup

339
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,951
package

340
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:32,767
And we click on Get File

341
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:38,655
Now we will take that key that was sent to us via the email

342
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
And we will force the update

343
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
And will add that key here

344
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
And we'll click continue

345
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,943
Sorry I just step back for a moment again

346
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:56,575
Because I realized I didn't explain what you'd seeing here and like I said before your

347
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:01,183
Package data of the owner of the package is displayed here

348
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:05,279
And the package details are displayed here

349
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:10,143
So if you have more than one component backed up all of those components will show

350
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,447
Here on the components being imported

351
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:13,983
And here

352
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
You will see the

353
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
The package owner

354
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Details

355
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:21,151
And get the key from this link here

356
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,687
So I will

357
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:26,015
Again do this import I just wanna to quickly

358
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,295
Get back to that

359
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,087
Let's Let's click continue

360
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:33,695
Wonderful so we have the component back

361
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,743
It's all being restored

362
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,303
And that's really what the purposes of the backup

363
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,607
Is it when something goes wrong

364
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:44,703
You can actually come back to where it was when the backup was made

365
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:53,663
We can test with a backup has been successfully restored by going to the compiler

366
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,223
And then selecting the component

367
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,783
And clicking on compile

368
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:05,439
And as you can see is been completely successfully built

369
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:09,791
And we can now click on install the demo component

370
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,607
And then we can even go

371
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:14,143
To the demo component

372
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,679
And see that

373
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,727
Everything is actually working

374
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
Adding a new look

375
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,127
There's a  all the various fields

376
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,663
As it usually

377
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
are

378
