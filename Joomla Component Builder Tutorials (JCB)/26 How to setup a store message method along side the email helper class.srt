00:00:00,768 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi

2
00:00:02,048 --> 00:00:06,656
I've already done a tutorial how to use the email helper in your components

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:10,240
And in that tutorial I actually do touch upon

4
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,800
The storing of messages

5
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:14,848
Or emails for that matter

6
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,640
Once it's been sent

7
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,712
Now I would like to just look at that again

8
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,808
For those of you that may just be wanting to know that

9
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
So

10
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,392
Obviously at this stage you should know

11
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:29,952
That the email helper class

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:33,024
it basically added to the helper folder

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
Of your components backend

14
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:40,704
So and it's usually called your components name and then email

15
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,056
That's that's the email helper class so to use it

16
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:51,456
In the custom script you could use the 3 braces brackets

17
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:55,296
Is that ok and then component like that

18
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,112
And then just email

19
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,440
And sent

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
And

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,536
That is how you would basically construct

22
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:06,560
Your

23
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:10,400
Your script I show that as well in the tutorial

24
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,192
We we going to more depths

25
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:14,752
of how to use the email helper

26
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:15,776
But

27
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
At the very bottom of this class in the send

28
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:20,896
Method

29
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:22,944
There is a little snippet

30
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,760
quite its significant as it may seem

31
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:28,832
Actually gives you a very great

32
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,368
Ability

33
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Because

34
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,696
The result

35
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,000
Of the email that was sent

36
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,304
Is placed in send email

37
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,680
This result is passed to the method as well

38
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,752
The first it looks in your helper class

39
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,568
Which is usually a component name

40
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,848
Helper

41
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,896
That's the helper class

42
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:57,760
And whether this method exists in that class

43
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,368
And this method will not exist unless you

44
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,392
Write it

45
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:04,672
So

46
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:08,256
The area where you would have to write this method

47
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:11,840
Is in the component there is an area

48
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
Called

49
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,912
Admin helper

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,728
Let's look at that

51
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
So we open a component

52
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
We go to libraries and helpers

53
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
we scroll down

54
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,784
And we see there is

55
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Email helper

56
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:35,648
And then underneath it helper admin class

57
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,256
And it's in this area that you need to add that method

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,424
Now I realized I've chosen the wrong components so this component actually does not use that storage concept

59
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,264
But there is another one that does let's open that one instead then

60
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,592
So again we are in

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,896
Helper admin class

62
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,200
And we have a function called

63
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:02,272
Store message and this is in the components

64
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
That where you edit your component

65
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,208
So this store message has what we call a signature

66
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:13,536
Values that it is passing to the method

67
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:17,376
And in the

68
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:18,912
The

69
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,960
Email helper class

70
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
You see that it

71
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
Also has

72
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
A signature

73
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,896
But wherever it gives this = with a value

74
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:33,760
That means that that's the default value so if you do not add

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,136
A value for this position there is one two three four fifth position

76
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:44,000
Then it will default to 0 if we do not add this it will default to null

77
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
So

78
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,656
From there all the way to the end all of those values haves basically the 

79
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,216
Null value

80
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:54,240
So

81
00:03:55,008 --> 00:04:00,128
In reality you only need to add you know these values the first four

82
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,408
But

83
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:05,504
Those values are all used in this method

84
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,880
So if you wanna understand exactly how these value should look look inside of the method

85
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:12,416
Read through the method

86
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
And you will see

87
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,488
So

88
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Making a long story short

89
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
We end up here at this little script

90
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,423
Basically ask whether you created the method or not

91
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
If you didn't it simple skips it and returns the value of send mail if it sees

92
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,615
That you have created it

93
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,455
It'll pass these variables that correspond to the signature

94
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:40,831
And then inside of that method that is in your helper class

95
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,135
That is now this method

96
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,463
You need to do the necessary checks and balances

97
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,511
And discovering

98
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,071
For example since you've got the email address

99
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
You can

100
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,655
Search

101
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
with the getVar

102
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:58,239
In the user class

103
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,775
It must equal

104
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:01,823
Email

105
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,359
Recipient

106
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,151
= email

107
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:07,711
And then returns to us the ID

108
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:09,247
So

109
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:12,575
That is basically how the getVar works

110
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,623
And

111
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,927
Then when we have the user ID

112
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:20,511
We can obviously make sure it's

113
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,095
The number and we set it to our message as user

114
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:28,447
And we set it as the email and now we can store

115
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:32,287
The message in whatever table or do whatever we wanna do

116
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,567
Beyond

117
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,103
The normal

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,687
So even if you wanna do other things except

119
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
Storing the message

120
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,319
This is the method inside of which you can do it so store message

121
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:48,671
Is the method inside which you can do some more custom scripting

122
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:52,255
On top of your email integration

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:59,423
Ok so that's just quickly giving a little bit more depth on that specific aspect

124
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,959
Of using

125
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,031
The email class in your component

126
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:05,055
Thank you for watching
