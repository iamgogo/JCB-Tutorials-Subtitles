00:00:02,304 --> 00:00:03,072
Hi

2
00:00:03,584 --> 00:00:08,448
I want to show you how to use the emailing helper class in your component

3
00:00:09,216 --> 00:00:14,592
The email helper class is a class that gets added to your components helper area

4
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:17,152
And therefore available on every page

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,248
And with which you can then send emails

6
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,600
We could look at the helper Class by going to a component that has it

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,624
Included

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:28,672
And then into helpers and

9
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:31,232
The filename is usually the component name

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,768
Email

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,816
If've opened it already here

12
00:00:35,584 --> 00:00:38,656
As you can see it's in just the basic abstract class

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:39,936
That

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:42,752
That takes Joomlas emailer

15
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,800
Which is this Jmail

16
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,616
And it gets an instance of it

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:51,200
And adds it to mail and then loads in

18
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:54,528
the variables that's required

19
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
Now

20
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:57,600
We'll come back to this in a moment

21
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,648
If you look at a component

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:01,696
What you need to do first

23
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:06,304
If you are gonna use this feature in any of your components

24
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,400
Let us open this

25
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:12,960
Learning manager

26
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,688
And then go to libraries and helpers

27
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,784
And you'll see that there add email helpers been set to on and that only

28
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:32,928
Places the helper class in your component that's all it does

29
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,488
It doesn't implemented anywhere else

30
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:36,768
So

31
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:40,352
At the moment that means that if you click yes here

32
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,424
You need to still create fields

33
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:46,496
That you are gonna load to your

34
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
config area

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,616
Now if you don't know about the config yet it means you've skipped some tutorials

36
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:55,456
But it's basically this area here

37
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:59,040
Which gives you the option to the ability to add

38
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,880
Configuration options to your components option area

39
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,744
So if we click here I scroll down you'll see that there is

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,560
Mail configuration and a whole lot of fields there

41
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:16,192
Now these Fields correspond to the Joomlas default Fields if you didn't know

42
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
So if you would like to create these Fields and you need some info on what there should be in what should be their names and

43
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,872
Everything

44
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:29,504
Then go look at the Joomla Global configuration XML

45
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:34,112
And you'll see all the settings in that file

46
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,232
For our purposes I'm simply gonna show you how the fields look like

47
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:41,280
We also have the dkim

48
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,584
implementation available

49
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,496
And even those Fields you will need to look at the code to know what their names should be

50
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,592
So there's a difference of course between name and label and description

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:57,920
When we refer to named and that is the

52
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,480
The value that will be used in the code

53
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,528
Ok I'll show you what I mean

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,576
I just close out here

55
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Go back to the code

56
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:10,976
So for example that word mailer

57
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Actually means

58
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
That the name of the field is called Mailer

59
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,264
The name of the field is called that and that

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,288
and so it goes on

61
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
So these are all the fields that needs to be set

62
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:29,408
If if if your component

63
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,200
If we go back to the component let me just

64
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Close this

65
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
You would see  there is a options area so I'm gonna open that

66
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,024
once it open your see there is a mail configuration and a dkim area

67
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,048
Dkim

68
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
So let's open a mail

69
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:50,400
You see that it has the mailer status

70
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,728
So it's either set to off then no emails will go out

71
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
or to on

72
00:03:55,520 --> 00:04:00,128
If it set to on you can decide whether you want to override the global function

73
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:01,664
The global

74
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
Variables

75
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:06,784
now the global variables are set in your Joomlas components

76
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,832
Global area

77
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:12,672
So you would go to Global configurations

78
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:17,536
And then

79
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
You'd go to

80
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:21,375
System

81
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,911
No sorry

82
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
It's server

83
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
And then there's this mail settings here

84
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
Ok

85
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:39,039
Now these are the main or the the global settings that will be used in the in any component that

86
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,063
Does not add

87
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,391
These settings in their config

88
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:45,183
So if you didn't create

89
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
Those Fields and added it to your component but you ticked the the button to sort of add the helper

90
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:52,863
Class to your component

91
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,143
Then

92
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,287
That means that it will basically fall back to these settings in your Joomla default

93
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Area

94
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,591
So

95
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,383
Just that you know

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:08,223
And these are the values that you need to overwrite if you want your

97
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,623
Component into some way to use other PHP mail or other send mail or

98
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,647
Other

99
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:18,463
What's the other one SMTP

100
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,303
Values than that of the global you need to set it here

101
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,351
And

102
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:27,167
That is basically what this area can do

103
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:30,751
So you use Global it falls back to the Joomla Global

104
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:34,335
Otherwise you can overwrite it on this level

105
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:36,383
And send it out

106
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:38,175
In a way that is

107
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,223
What you would like

108
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
The DKIM area

109
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,183
Is there more advanced area which basically allows you to overwrite

110
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487
Overwrite sorry not overwrite to encrypt

111
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:58,143
And secure email sent out from you to authenticate that it was really you that send it

112
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
This is very helpful to sort of show your the people that receive these emails that it's not

113
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:10,943
Spam and it's really comes from you it's more advanced I would encourage you to read up on it these are the values

114
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,551
Usually would be required to be added private key a public key

115
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,623
And obviously these type of areas here

116
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:24,767
If this is set to no obviously it will not be used if it set to yes please ensure to add the values

117
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Otherwise it still will not be used

118
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,351
Ok

119
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:32,191
So that's basically the values that you needs to still create

120
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:34,751
Component does not do this for you

121
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,031
You need to do it

122
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,615
I could possibly foresee that

123
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:41,919
In the future we might add this

124
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
If you tick the helper class it adds these values for you

125
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:48,575
But even then if you have done it manually

126
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,391
We'll make sure that it doesn't add in twice

127
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
So as long as

128
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
These values obviously be the same

129
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Names we will know actually a

130
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
Somehow identify that

131
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:00,607
And then not

132
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:02,399
Add them dynamically

133
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
So to avoid clashes

134
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,335
But for the meantime it's not automatically being added and so you need to do that manually if you want it

135
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,407
To be there if you don't like I've said before

136
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,711
It will fall back to the Joomla Global

137
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
So to explain that you on the code level

138
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,599
Basically it gets from the configuration

139
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,159
The mailer function

140
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,231
And then it checks whether it's global

141
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:28,767
If it is global

142
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,303
Then

143
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,071
It

144
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,863
Implements Joomlas

145
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
Values

146
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:37,727
If it's not Global it implements your components values

147
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
And

148
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,567
That is basically what it will do

149
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,639
Now you can read through the code

150
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,711
But the most important area really is this area

151
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:51,295
To know what is all the various

152
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:54,111
Options that you have in the signature

153
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,647
To send out Mail

154
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:00,255
So it's able to really send out a lot of mail but

155
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
Nonetheless

156
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,095
You're also need to consider

157
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:04,863
You know

158
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:07,679
Your servers own limitations

159
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,239
Since we obviously don't want you to spam people

160
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:12,031
We do not

161
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:17,407
Overwrite those values. We are simply using the Joomla default

162
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,503
Helper Joomla sorry jmailer

163
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,855
And it is been extended from another class

164
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,927
And so there are a lot of features and here

165
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:31,999
And if you wanna know more about them

166
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:35,327
you can read up on on obviously the jmailer

167
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:36,863
Class from Joomla

168
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:40,447
As well as read through this code here and see how we implemented

169
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:43,519
These are the dkim values that you would need

170
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,823
And in your

171
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,359
In your component

172
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:51,455
To be able to use the dkim encryption

173
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,807
But you could also read up on this and check out this function here

174
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,087
up till there

175
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,903
In its way that it's implementing these features

176
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:05,279
It obviously is adding it to the mailer and most of the work is done in the mailer

177
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:09,375
So it's basically adding the data to the mailer and the mailer takes care of the rest

178
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,703
Ok and so here it sends it off

179
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,495
And if there is an error

180
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
So let's say for some reason it didn't

181
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,127
you know work out well

182
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
Then it shakes whether

183
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,711
Your

184
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:24,735
Component

185
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
Helper class

186
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
So your component has a helper class it's just this file here

187
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,695
Even has a storemessage

188
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,719
Variable

189
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:36,767
or method

190
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,839
So if we were to go check this

191
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:47,007
You see that there is the storemessage method

192
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:52,895
In the helper class this is a custom method that I wrote now you can write it anywhere you like

193
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,711
But this signature should be the same

194
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
Ok so

195
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:57,759
here

196
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,063
Is the same signature you'll see it

197
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:02,879
So basically this area that

198
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
And that is dynamically updated to your component

199
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:10,559
So it uses your component name here and your component name there

200
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
But this store message

201
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:14,911
Is basically

202
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:15,935
Not

203
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:22,335
You cannot change that but it takes to send email the recipient the subject the body to text only in the mode and it's says

204
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,615
That it's email

205
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:28,223
So you can have different types so if you look at the the method

206
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,015
The type can be anything

207
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:36,415
We are obviously wanting to do different things on different type so if we send an SMS and we didn't

208
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,183
Fail

209
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:39,743
You wanna store the message if we did this or that

210
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:42,815
So this this kind of feature

211
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
Is it only used when something didn't work

212
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,471
But also if it worked

213
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
If it was sent

214
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:52,799
It's gonna store it

215
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:56,127
So it's a way to store the message

216
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,151
So that you can

217
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,687
Maybe let your user go

218
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,711
If they login

219
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:02,527
They can see messages sent to them and this kind of stuff

220
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:07,647
So this is what the store message does and as you see it's whole huge custom

221
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,975
Method that I wrote

222
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,535
And it does different things for different

223
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,935
You can update it in change it pause the video copy it down don't really matter

224
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:26,335
Just if you realize this is actually something you write up yourself you just need to make sure that that part is the same

225
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:28,383
The rest is up to you

226
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
Now you deal with it ok so that is really implementing the learning manager emailer

227
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,855
In your component

228
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,695
Maybe I should show you where I implemented at least

229
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
In one area ok let me do that

230
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:50,911
Ok so I have this component called job tracking system if I open it up

231
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:57,311
You'll see that it actually has that function

232
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
Adding the helper email it's got it selected you see there add helper

233
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:09,087
Set it to on

234
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:14,975
Then the view in which we are using the email method is the job or the view

235
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Basically we want to email the client

236
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,119
I did job order

237
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,911
When when it's created

238
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,751
So let me show you how I implemented it there

239
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,103
So here is the job order

240
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
And

241
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
I would basically then

242
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Click on

243
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,831
This area here email now I can update that

244
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
to whatever email I like

245
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:43,903
Testing

246
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
@

247
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
vdm.io or something

248
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
Just send it in to

249
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Nothing

250
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
And

251
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:55,679
Then once the email has been sent

252
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
It actually let's me know

253
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
See there in the it says email was sent successfully

254
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
So

255
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,479
That's basically what the emailer does it just this button it sends this

256
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Document

257
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
To my

258
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Client

259
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:17,439
And also if I want to send it to my store

260
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,231
The people that does the job

261
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,535
I could also do that here

262
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,095
I'm not gonna explain to you

263
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:29,983
The reality of taking this content adding it to the email and sending it

264
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
That I would suspect you need to know and you need to learn or study to do that yourself

265
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,735
I'm I'm simply explaining to you how to use the email helper class

266
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
So we will go to the code and I'll show you how I do it and

267
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:45,855
Mostly

268
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,951
Maybe I'll give you some pointers but I won't go into detail

269
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,743
About how that is done

270
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,327
Ok so let's go to the to the code

271
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,655
So here we are in the job order

272
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:02,495
So first thing here is obviously some JavaScript

273
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:07,615
So there's the send email function

274
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:10,175
and Gets a set of values

275
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,783
And then it basically gives it over to the send

276
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:19,391
Email server function which sends it as a J object

277
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:23,743
Sorry  a json request to the server

278
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
The send

279
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,839
Email is the

280
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
Task

281
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
And when it gets a response that's when you get the notification

282
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:36,543
Ok so that's Simply the JavaScript of it

283
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
So now if we go to PHP

284
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Previous

285
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,991
Tutorials we explain how to use the Ajax class

286
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:47,039
I'm gonna just touched on it briefly

287
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
You basically have your input here

288
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,159
This is where you put set up your controller

289
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,207
Let me show you that

290
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,279
So you'll see in your controller

291
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,583
There is this send email

292
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,167
Class that's what basically was defined

293
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
And this field here

294
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:08,031
And you see that there is

295
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,079
Basically three variables

296
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
And they are

297
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,991
Should be filtered in this way and they are fast over to these methods

298
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:19,039
And you should be logged in user

299
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:25,439
So if you look at the code again it basically this is the task down here it triggers the task

300
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
It checks for those values and then passes it over to

301
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
This method which is in the

302
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:36,191
Model is a model

303
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,727
So we go to models

304
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:39,263
Ajax

305
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:44,383
So here is the the model let's just scroll down to the send email

306
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,199
So here is the send email and this again

307
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:48,735
Is a custom

308
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Script

309
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:52,319
So if I was to go back here

310
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
I Close this

311
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:57,183
You'd see there's the in this

312
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:03,583
Ajax method is a lot I mean look at that you can see that scroll down way down is a lot of other custom methods here

313
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,911
But this is another custom method I've written

314
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:10,239
Call send mail gets the mail the HTML to type

315
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,799
It it does the necessary

316
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,335
Cleansing and whatever

317
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
And then

318
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:16,639
It

319
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
Basically

320
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,223
Over

321
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Here

322
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
We're calling the email helper

323
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
We using the send method

324
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
we Passing the valuables and we

325
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:34,303
Set the result in here

326
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,887
And if the results is obviously true

327
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:43,775
We will let the user know otherwise we give him the error

328
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
ok so that

329
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:46,847
That is the

330
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,383
The short end of it

331
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:54,783
I'm also using this email body to help me build the the email because I want to

332
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:59,391
Make sure that it's got all the necessary HTML and stuff so you can

333
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
Pause this video and type that out if you like

334
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:10,399
But this is the email body that I usually use and you can see you passing the HTML on the subject to it

335
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:13,983
And it simply adds the the subject to the

336
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
Email

337
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,567
The necessary places as well as the body

338
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,359
In the necessary place

339
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,639
Right there

340
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,735
So that it gets send in a way that's more appropriate

341
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
And then

342
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:28,575
That's all happening right here

343
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:32,671
Ok and that is what I'm passing in here

344
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:39,071
So a custom method which gets the data from

345
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,119
the Ajax

346
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,399
And then sends it off

347
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,055
So that's a quick tutorial on how to implement sending emails through your component

348
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,871
Using the email helper class

349
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,687
Obviously the email helper class

350
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,967
Is

351
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:01,599
Available on GitHub in in the component Builder

352
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:06,719
And if you feel that our implementation lacks some professional

353
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:13,631
Help then please do make a commit to Quest or send me an email

354
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:17,471
And we'll gladly update an improved this class

355
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,799
Although I think we are followed

356
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,151
All the necessary standard and requirements to make it useful to everyone

357
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,711
Ok thanks for watching

358
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Until next time
