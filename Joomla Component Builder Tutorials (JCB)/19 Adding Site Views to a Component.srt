00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:01,024
Hi

2
00:00:01,536 --> 00:00:07,680
Now let's look at adding admin views and site views to component Builders component

3
00:00:08,448 --> 00:00:13,312
And looking at all the different switches and the nice features that we have there installed for you

4
00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:15,872
So we first login here

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:21,760
Then we have component builder open on the component builder

6
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:24,576
And then we will go to

7
00:00:25,856 --> 00:00:26,368
Let's see components

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
And we will open

9
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:31,744
Sermon

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:32,512
Distributor

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,632
And then go to settings

12
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:46,336
And in settings you see there is a place for admin views we're ready illustrated adding the admin views

13
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,920
Then there's custom admin views and their site views

14
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:56,576
And we wanna look at those now so I'll just click on add custom admin View

15
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,648
There isn't any added to this component because component builder

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,440
Sorry

17
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,744
sermon distributor does not have

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,024
a Custom admin views

19
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
But I'll illustrate it in another component for you

20
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,400
Then site views

21
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,216
It has quite a few

22
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:15,776
You might sometimes open it and see

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:18,336
That some of the buttons are not selected

24
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:21,664
Although you know you selected it previously and saved

25
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
You know now doesn't show

26
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,992
This is a glitch and

27
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,016
In the

28
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:27,552
Joomla's own

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,112
JavaScript or whatever

30
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:36,768
That is causing this and so the only way I have found to solve it as yet is to simply

31
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
re-open

32
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:41,120
Like for now you see the admin view that's same issue

33
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:44,448
So if you close it and open it again

34
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,984
It has it all selected

35
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
This is a heads up keep a look out for this because if you make changes and save it with those buttons unticked

36
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,480
Your build will

37
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:58,784
Not include those values

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,576
Since it will be stored as null

39
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,880
And

40
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:05,184
Yeah you might get unexpected results

41
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:08,768
So always make sure that your old ticks are

42
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,328
All in place that just a heads up

43
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,144
Not really something I can change at this stage it is a

44
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,192
Joomla thing

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
of the repeatable fields

46
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,056
Ok so if we go to site view

47
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,592
And we just

48
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,128
Close it again and

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,664
Open it again

50
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,456
You see everything is selected

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,784
You see that it has 123

52
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,064
4 options here

53
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:34,880
Obviously here you select the site views

54
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Just add as many as you like

55
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:43,584
Then add menu means that this site view will be added to the add menu

56
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,144
Aspect of Joomla

57
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
You know If you go to create menu

58
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:50,752
And then you go to add menu

59
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:52,032
Item

60
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,568
Then there is a select

61
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
Type and when you click on select type then there is this list

62
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,688
Articles and whatever

63
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:04,320
Now if you say yes there you'll create a XML file

64
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,856
Which allows

65
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:09,184
Joomla to notice that your component needs to be in the list

66
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:12,512
And the XML file we will look at in the moment

67
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,072
But that's just you know that's what this

68
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,608
Switch here add menu does

69
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Add metadata means that

70
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
this page

71
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:29,152
Is gonna actually make use of the Net the metadata

72
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
That is being passed to it

73
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,576
Usually that means that in your model you've set up your data

74
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,368
So that there is a

75
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,232
Metadata in the items array or in the

76
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,816
In the item array or in the this array

77
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
Either By by

78
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
The global setting or

79
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,984
By the the actual item

80
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
So this is meta implementation

81
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
You even if you set yes here

82
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,664
And you did not

83
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
Set up the data in the in the model

84
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:10,880
Correctly it won't work and the way for you to look at that is obviously click yes here try

85
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,488
your best setting up the data the model then compile and go look in the view

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
.HTML.PHP file to see how it grabs the meta data because it will still add

87
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:25,983
The Script that is needed to load the metadata into the

88
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:27,775
the document

89
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:30,847
But if it doesn't

90
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:32,383
Grab it correctly

91
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,431
Then you'd see that as well

92
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,223
Ok then

93
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:39,295
Whether you can only have one default View

94
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
So don't click more than one to yes

95
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:47,743
but what the default view effectively is is that sometimes when

96
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:52,607
You make a change and the system doesn't know where you wanna go

97
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,423
It actually throws you back to the default View

98
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,799
Know that default view could either be your sights default view being home page

99
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:08,223
Or it can be if your in this component it could be for example on this one it's preachers

100
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:09,759
So

101
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:14,879
Let's say some of these views you set that they don't user

102
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:21,279
a Public user don't have access for example to sermon then if they try to access that page

103
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:26,399
The system will throw them back to the default view and give him a message saying you don't have access

104
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:29,471
And so that's what the default View

105
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,263
Primarily used for at the moment

106
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,151
But I can see it being coming even more useful as we continue to improve in component Builder

107
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,455
Then add access

108
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:45,599
It's basically making sure that a Sydney user has the specific access rights

109
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,951
You see in a in an item you can set the access rights

110
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,279
As well as the view rights

111
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:55,583
So it's multiple implementations

112
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:01,983
Different implementations one's access groups the other one is just groups

113
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:06,847
And so you can tweak whether you want access on this specific View to be monitored

114
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:07,871
And

115
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:09,151
If you tick that

116
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Then

117
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:13,503
Component building will ensure that the access

118
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
Table is there

119
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Ok

120
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:19,135
So that is adding a site view

121
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
to

122
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:21,951
to your component

123
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
Obviously after having created the site view

124
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,583
Then this is how you can add it to check it

125
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
See how it works

126
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,447
Ok now next up we gonna look at

127
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:35,007
Custom admin views being added

128
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,543
Thank you for watching
