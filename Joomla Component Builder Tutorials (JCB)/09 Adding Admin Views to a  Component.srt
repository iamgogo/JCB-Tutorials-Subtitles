00:00:01,024 --> 00:00:01,536
Hi

2
00:00:02,816 --> 00:00:05,632
We've looked at setting up admin views we've looked at

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:08,448
Creating fields for admin views

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,336
We've looked at setting up field types and how to use field types to create fields

5
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:16,896
Now we would like to look at

6
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:20,224
Setting the admin views to the component

7
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:26,112
Obviously the component itself has so much things that you can do

8
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:27,648
I'm gonna try and

9
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
Deal with it

10
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:29,952
Little at a time

11
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,536
So I'm first gonna just look at adding

12
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:34,816
The

13
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:37,376
Admin views to a component

14
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:39,168
Ok so

15
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
We'll go to components

16
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,544
And will go to sermon distributor

17
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,272
And you would go to settings

18
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:56,064
Here you'd see

19
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,856
Admin views

20
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:05,792
So to connect admin views to your component and you need to go to settings and open this button here

21
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,400
Usually when you start it will look like this

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
So very straight forward

23
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,568
You have a drop down here

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,128
And you make a selection selection

25
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:22,176
And then click next

26
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
And you do the next one

27
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,832
And if you have a lot of Admin views like I Do here

28
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:29,600
You would

29
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:32,672
Type in the name of the admin View

30
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,488
And there you have it

31
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,328
So I'm gonna type in the name here sermon

32
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:44,448
Now these icons here I spoken about them previously

33
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:47,520
They are the icons from Joomla

34
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,592
Which is called I think I let me just look

35
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,200
Standard

36
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
Icomoon font

37
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,296
Ok so it's this

38
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
This font here

39
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,112
Now

40
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
If you select a

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,720
an icon here

42
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,072
It'll show you that little icon but only during the selection face

43
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,352
So

44
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:14,144
That is the icon

45
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,936
That is gonna be used

46
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,496
For the view

47
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,288
Here in the right

48
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:22,080
See this icon there

49
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,616
As we click through

50
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,664
Component Builder

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
It updates that icon

52
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,504
Ok so this icon

53
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,552
Is what is being set here

54
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:35,136
Now you can select the icons to

55
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Reflect

56
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,976
to the admin view of your choice

57
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,816
Now we have a bunch of switches here and I'll look at them one at a time

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Now admin menu

59
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
Is basically this menu

60
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:54,080
So the question is do you want that View to show up next to your main

61
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,360
View

62
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,408
I'll be the first

63
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
Tick box

64
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,224
So we would say yes

65
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:01,248
Then

66
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Do you want to have an add record

67
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Icon

68
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,624
For this view

69
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,696
Now the add record icon if you go to the dashboard

70
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,488
Is this

71
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,768
This icon here

72
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,864
Basically a shortcut to creating an admin View

73
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,144
From the dashboard

74
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
So

75
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,216
Will say yes

76
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
Then

77
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:27,872
A dashboard list of records icon

78
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,968
So maybe you don't want this icon just a Add new

79
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
Then you can tick that as no

80
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
But again here we would like yes

81
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,392
Then a submenu

82
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:41,440
Now the submenu if you've opened

83
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
Your

84
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,328
View that has a submenu here that can collapse away

85
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,632
Now this submenu

86
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:52,704
You can add this view

87
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,008
To the sub menu or not

88
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056
Then

89
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,848
auto check-in

90
00:03:59,104 --> 00:03:59,872
Is a

91
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:06,784
Little tweak that I've added to to my Joomla components and I'm possibly gonna

92
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:10,112
Make a pull request to add it to Joomla itself

93
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,392
What

94
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
auto check-in does

95
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,000
Is it Adds a feature to your component

96
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Since you see I have clients that complaint

97
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,375
That some people will open an item

98
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,471
And then in the browser click back instead of clicking clothes

99
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,287
And that will keep the item locked out

100
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,311
to that

101
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,591
Individual

102
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:34,943
And so others cannot access it on less they have admin rights to check it back in

103
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
So we created an auto check-in

104
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,295
Now auto check-in checks

105
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:43,391
Whether this item has been checked out longer than a set period

106
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:48,767
and ever it has been it checks it in automatically know that set period Is

107
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:54,399
Something that the administrative sets in the global settings of the component

108
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,191
I'll show you that later

109
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,471
Just that you know

110
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
You can add auto check-in to a view

111
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,335
By either saying yes or no here

112
00:05:03,359 --> 00:05:06,431
Then keeping history of a

113
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Backend view

114
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,135
Now the history component I must tell you is maybe one of them most exciting things that I could integrate

115
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,743
You see what it does is it keeps track of every change you make

116
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:23,583
In any article or any item in your application

117
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,375
So for example

118
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,447
If I was to go to

119
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Let's just look at just a moment

120
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
To a Preacher

121
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,199
And I would open up this acapella music

122
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:46,367
You'd see that it has that version button here at the top

123
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,743
No if I was gonna make a change here let's say I typed in

124
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:55,583
Info@vdm

125
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:57,375
And I set

126
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,447
Some text here

127
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,263
And I clicked save

128
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,127
And then I clicked on version

129
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,223
You see that it's now locked a new version

130
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
And there are the old ones

131
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:19,135
And I could click on one of the old ones and click Well

132
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,463
First let me say I could take the one I'm on currently

133
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
And I get say keep

134
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,583
That would sort of lock it in because

135
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:32,959
You can also set how long How long How long amount of History should the system keep

136
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
The default is 10, 10 changes so I can click on the previous version and say restore

137
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,967
And this will restore it and you see there

138
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
Email address is gone and this description is gone

139
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:51,903
If I want to go back to the one I have done I could just click there on version again

140
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
I then click there and also restore

141
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
And

142
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,279
Now

143
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,815
We would see wow

144
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
The details are Back Again

145
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:06,495
That is the feature of history now history component is actually a Joomla extension

146
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
Which

147
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:11,103
You're able as a application to the component developer

148
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
Integrate into your own

149
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,687
Components

150
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:17,759
And it's not that easy in fact it's maybe very

151
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,527
Difficult

152
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:22,367
If I was to show you the amount of code let me do that

153
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
That you need to write

154
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:29,023
First of all you need to add

155
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,351
An asset ID to all your

156
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:34,911
Backend view database tables

157
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,215
So if we were to go to

158
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
sermon distributor

159
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
And check our wait this is the

160
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
Frontend let's go to the backend

161
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
And we check out it's sql table so we'll click on that

162
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,671
You'd see that all of them have asset_ids

163
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
Now

164
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
That is

165
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,839
Really not as easy as it is

166
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
Once you've got the asset_id

167
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Then in your model

168
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,031
When you basically save

169
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,151
Sorry not in the model

170
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,943
I think it is in table

171
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,855
When you start your table you should set up observers

172
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
The check

173
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,951
The specific

174
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,023
Item to add history options

175
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:33,791
to

176
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,559
to that

177
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,863
Asset_id

178
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,703
So this is this is part of the whole

179
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,311
Part of the script that is being add this is being added on the right place

180
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,359
As well as in the store method

181
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
There is another

182
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,967
Tweak which I

183
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,527
might take too long to look at all of that

184
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,367
Will go into more detail in the advanced courses I suppose

185
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
But just let you know

186
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:03,231
I create an import export method

187
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,815
And even in the import and export of data actually

188
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,631
Primarily in importing of data

189
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,167
You need to again

190
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:17,567
Do a quite advanced trick to ensure that the history of that I can will still be tracked

191
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:23,455
and these kind of features I just added dynamically to your component because of that switch

192
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,575
No that's not the only code the code that really throws people out I suppose

193
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,367
Is this script code

194
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,927
and this is if Script that is used

195
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
When the component installs

196
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
So if you look at this

197
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,607
This is the uninstall area in the script code

198
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:47,007
Which runs when you uninstall the component and it's looking in many places it's looking in content-type it's

199
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,287
Looking in the content

200
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Tag map

201
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,871
Is looking in the ucm base

202
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:55,711
Looking in the content types again and per view I mean

203
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,991
This is not just

204
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,879
Once off per view these checks are done and we are removing any items

205
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,671
That might remain there

206
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,975
Because when you uninstall a component

207
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:09,023
What you don't realize

208
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:15,423
Is it so integrated into the Joomla system that just removing it's on tables actually doesn't do the job

209
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:22,079
So we added the feature that if you uninstall it actually cleans the Joomla system of that extension

210
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:28,479
Completely which is ideal because you won't want any traces left you you would like to uninstall something

211
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
You want it gone

212
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,367
And so this uninstall method does exactly that

213
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,439
And then with the installing of this component we

214
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:42,303
get here which is the postflight install

215
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:44,095
We actually add

216
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,887
Many records to

217
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:49,471
Areas inside of Joomla so for example

218
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,799
Inside of the let me see

219
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,871
the contents type

220
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:59,711
We we need to add this information

221
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:04,575
And we have to do it for every view which you've selected

222
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,623
either tags or

223
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,415
History

224
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:13,279
We'll look at the tags in the category concept

225
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,303
Just a little bit

226
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:15,327
Later

227
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:18,399
Just to get a heads up and I realize this is not the place for it

228
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:20,959
But let me just say we will look at that OK so let me continue

229
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:27,359
Ok content types as you see we are adding it for the

230
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:32,223
Sermons we adding it for the series's we're adding it for the statistics and for the help documents

231
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,319
And that is when we install their component we are needs to add

232
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,647
You not seeing the whole picture let me scroll a bit look at that

233
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,695
String that needs to be

234
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,743
Written and

235
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,791
Added to the database

236
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Of these specific areas

237
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:53,471
To create that integration where it will track the object change and just do it automatically

238
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
So all this is generated by component Builder

239
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,639
And then when you do an update now here is the issue

240
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
When you do an update and you're adding a new

241
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
Field

242
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
to I view

243
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,927
This update will make sure that that specific field also will get tracked

244
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,719
So what it first does

245
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:20,863
Is it gets the data it tries to see whether it already exists if it exists

246
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:22,399
It means it's here

247
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,191
It just updates it

248
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
If it's been for some reason removed

249
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,799
It then inserts it

250
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,847
So that is the update method

251
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,711
The update method also takes care of the little lot of discrepancies

252
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:40,575
Because as you develop your extension now

253
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:43,135
These two faces to development

254
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:47,231
The one fase when you're busy building it and no one else in the world that has it

255
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:52,863
That's very easy face in fact then you don't really use this nice feature

256
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:57,727
You just uninstall it and reinstall it every time until you happy with what you see

257
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:04,639
But then once you put it out in the public you can't just step up your database structure without

258
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
The needed scripting for others to do a easy upgrade

259
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:13,599
Because they already got data in the database there can't just uninstall and install

260
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
That's that's ridiculous

261
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,231
No component builder has a way for you to actually address that

262
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,095
Well obviously because I have to deal with it and I don't wanna have my clients complain

263
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,239
So I added a feature which will look at it inside of component Builders component area

264
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
and I'll explain it in detail but just that you know this part of the update feature you making use of

265
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:43,807
You're a specific integration to keep track of your

266
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:45,599
Backend view changes

267
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:49,183
To items is in Place already

268
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:52,511
Written by component Builders telling you here

269
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,559
On which line it was done

270
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
If you have that switch trip

271
00:13:57,119 --> 00:14:00,447
Ok so that is just giving you a quick glimpse into the code

272
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,471
Of

273
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,263
A little switch

274
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
Sorry

275
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,919
a Little switch called

276
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Keep history

277
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,551
So this weeks does all that for you for this specific View

278
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,087
Then

279
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
Depending on whether you gonna use this views information on the front end as your main base for your

280
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
For your page you might wanna add

281
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
Metadata

282
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,655
The metadata is I know isn't that

283
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,215
Useful anymore but you know what

284
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:37,311
Although Google and others are maybe ignoring it

285
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,919
It still plays a role to making a page

286
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,479
Very search engine optimised

287
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,527
Component Builder

288
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
If

289
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:50,879
If you do your homework and you do things right

290
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,487
In relationship to implementation of your metadata

291
00:14:56,511 --> 00:15:01,631
You'd see that it actually adds tremendous good features to

292
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,423
Do your front end of your site

293
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,263
So I would suggest that you add

294
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:13,663
Metadata when you are gonna use a specific area to the front and when we start looking at us setting up the site

295
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,431
Views

296
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
You'll see this

297
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Coming up again and

298
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
The necessity of using it

299
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
Obviously you'll be remodeling the data because you can get relationship from many databases but

300
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:29,791
You need the area in the backend to get the data right

301
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:32,863
Ok then this access switch

302
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Might throw you out

303
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,191
This simply adds

304
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,727
The following feature

305
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:41,311
If you open an article in the open publish

306
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,359
It says here access

307
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:45,663
Public super registered

308
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
Which is relating to your user

309
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,039
Let me just close this

310
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
you user access levels

311
00:15:55,135 --> 00:16:00,511
And as you know user access levels can target multiple groups into one user access level

312
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,351
And so this again is only a feature that will really be

313
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:11,263
Extremely useful when you look at your front end of your component and the backend you can also make use of it

314
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,287
Of course

315
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:18,687
You can change the access of a specific item but since we also have such a intense permissional

316
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,967
Switches

317
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:25,855
I hardly ever make use of it but it's there and I mostly use it for front end

318
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:31,743
When I want a certain area in the front of sorry set an item not to be accessible to the front

319
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:38,143
Ok then do you want to add to import export function again this is a

320
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:44,543
Extended area which component builder dynamically just adds so you don't need to do anything is to 

321
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,103
relation to scripting at this stage

322
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,431
You could just click yes or no to import export

323
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:52,735
Feature at the top of the page

324
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,295
Of every View

325
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
So every View

326
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:03,231
Will have an import export at the moment it's a direct relationship import export what I mean by that

327
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
Is

328
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
You need to follow

329
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:12,447
If you export this then you'd see the the way it should look to do import

330
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:18,591
And the import is really nice you can map the headers to their specific database tables

331
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:23,711
Obviously there's work needed especially when you're dealing with

332
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:30,367
Information that was encrypted if you export it it will decrypt it if you have the permissions

333
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,767
To access that item of course but the problem is because it's decrypting yet

334
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:43,167
When you imported it doesn't know that it should encrypted so there is a little discrepancy with the advance

335
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:49,567
Storing methods so as long as you are having a data backend database table that at

336
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:55,967
Actually doesn't require these advance storing methods it's just your normal defaults like me explain before then

337
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:58,527
Import export method will then works seemingly

338
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Without any problems

339
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,719
I'm so I'm still working on this area but it's already working well enough that I felt I could leave it in there

340
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:12,095
Ok that is the switch here and obviously if you don't like the feature just click no

341
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,471
Then here is a feature which I think I'm most excited about

342
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,495
And that is

343
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Every backend view

344
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,151
Has of course and edit area right if you've selected that

345
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
Read write option then the edit area you can change the values of that backend listview right

346
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:34,367
So

347
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,927
The admin create site View

348
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,255
Means that the system

349
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,559
Is gonna dynamically build

350
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
The front

351
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:45,887
Area

352
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,191
Which you can access

353
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:51,775
To edit the data at the front of the website

354
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
Now Yahoo this is the hurray whatever that's excellent tool

355
00:18:58,687 --> 00:19:02,783
So it takes exactly this if I was to use this and as an example

356
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
It takes

357
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,439
This editing area and place it on the front

358
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:10,975
Of your website

359
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,767
Now obviously

360
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:19,167
You are controlling in the permissional structures who has access to edit this who access to edit this

361
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:23,519
The status was access to edit specific fields

362
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:27,359
We looked at adding the fields to your admin views and you could tick

363
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:30,687
Whether this field should have permissional structure

364
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,455
Now

365
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:32,735
That means that

366
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:35,551
If you have those things set up in the back in the

367
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,599
Global professional tab

368
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
Then it will be implemented in the

369
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,999
Front if a certain user is in the in the correct group

370
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:50,399
They wont be able to access this then if they have access but they don't have the right to for example update

371
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:52,447
Maybe the modified date or

372
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:57,311
The status is then in the front there also will not be able to do that so you have

373
00:19:57,567 --> 00:20:00,127
Immense control over who can do what

374
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:07,039
But at the same time you have the ability to actually edit items on the front I think that is

375
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
Excellent

376
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:13,439
To be able to do that and that all of that just possible by saying yes

377
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
But

378
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,487
Realize this

379
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:18,303
The fact that it creates the

380
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
The view if I could says so

381
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
And places it on the front

382
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:28,031
Doesn't mean that there is a link somewhere to it

383
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:32,895
That is something you need to add to your site front custom site

384
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,687
As you develop it

385
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:41,087
And this is partly a feature therefore which is you don't know PHP and if you're not that familiar with

386
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:45,439
How to setup your links on the front of the component

387
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
You would possibly would find this difficult to implement

388
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,071
But I will show you

389
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:54,655
What it builds in fact I can show you that now

390
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:58,495
I have a component which I'm using that feature quite a lot

391
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:00,799
And it's called

392
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,943
Costbenefitprojection this is the backend

393
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,759
So if we look at the views we have here

394
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:11,039
called company

395
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:12,831
And we have

396
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,879
One called

397
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:19,232
Scaling factor and intervention

398
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:24,096
Now these are editing views as you can see those other list views those are the editing views

399
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
If I go to the front of the of the the website

400
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
and I open that component

401
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,288
And I click on View

402
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,336
You see that there is company

403
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:38,944
There is intervention and there is scaling factors

404
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
they

405
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
Are basically being extended here

406
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:48,160
So what the component build does is as is it adds this view

407
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
It also adds the module for it

408
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,536
And I'm also adds the controller for it

409
00:21:54,304 --> 00:22:00,448
So basically it puts all the script in place so that all you need to do is inside of for example

410
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
I have here a

411
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:06,336
I have here an area called cpanel now let me show you this component briefly

412
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,992
Ok so this is just some dummy data that I

413
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:15,296
Placed in here none of them is real

414
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,600
And so here

415
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,160
You can open multiple items

416
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:28,096
This is all stuff that I built in component in fact none of this was built outside of component builder

417
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,400
It all was done in component builder

418
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,472
And you can click on edit advance profile

419
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,800
And it will open the editing area

420
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:43,968
As you can see and now this is the backend editing area of that now let me show you sorry this is the front end

421
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
Editing area

422
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
And as you can see there are all the

423
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,368
Tabs

424
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,184
Now let me show you the backend

425
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,000
Here's the backend area

426
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:00,864
So it's basically a showing up the same information in the front

427
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,424
Is only dumps the permission and

428
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
Publishing features

429
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:10,080
But that is because of access permissions is done automatically

430
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,920
Because that front-end user didn't have permissions to edit things

431
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:16,736
In most of the things in here in fact

432
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:19,040
You didn't have the right to edit any of these

433
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:25,696
Therefore it didn't need to see it and so the system just remove that tab same goes with the permissions

434
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:29,536
And if you didn't have the right to do scaling factors on interventions

435
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:32,352
You also have dumped that it won't show it up

436
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,632
In the front

437
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:37,472
And so this is the back end of that same dummy company

438
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,264
That I've set up

439
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,336
And you can see that it basically

440
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,872
Moved it to the front

441
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:51,040
Not only did it make it possible to edit data but also to create new companies

442
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,832
So if you click on that

443
00:23:55,648 --> 00:24:00,768
You see it opens up in the area for you to start fresh so you can create a company from scratch

444
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Now

445
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,656
In this specific example you see that it cannot actually add a user

446
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:10,496
So what the system is done through some custom scripting that I've added

447
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:13,312
If you click save it adds his ID in here

448
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:15,872
And he doesn't need to select that

449
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
Ok so that's just a quick look at

450
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,992
That specific button

451
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:27,904
Called edit create site view it adds the whole codebase to the front

452
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:30,720
And integrates it to the

453
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,000
Way that the front

454
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:35,072
Needs to be able to control the permissions

455
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:41,472
Then the order of of the items are Simply the way in which it will be displayed anywhere

456
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,032
So if we think about the order

457
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,568
For a moment here

458
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
Of

459
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
Example component builder

460
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,760
The order of which these icons are laid out and even if you opened one of them

461
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,808
The order in which this is done

462
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:58,368
And also for the sub menu

463
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
All of that is controlled with this order

464
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Number here

465
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
Ok so

466
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,584
That's a quick look at adding

467
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,144
Admin views to your component

468
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:15,008
I hope that is insightful enough for you to understand how to do that

469
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:19,616
If you have any questions please you're welcome to send me a mail

470
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,968
Thanks for watching
