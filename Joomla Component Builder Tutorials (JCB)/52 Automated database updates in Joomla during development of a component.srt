1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:03,840
I would like to give you a explanation

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:05,632
As well as demonstration

3
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:09,472
Of how JCB deals with Joomla's

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,264
Implementation

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,824
when regards to creating of

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,360
Database tables

7
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:19,712
As well as updating them or even adding more

8
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:24,576
Joomla's way of doing this through specific file convention

9
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:27,136
Within your components file structure

10
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
Package

11
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,744
JCB is also been

12
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:36,352
Designed to actually detect changes in your component development

13
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,656
And create with files for you

14
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:44,032
The best way to illustrate this is well just let's compile a component

15
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,080
So we have

16
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:48,128
sermon distributer here

17
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:50,176
that's gonna compile that for us

18
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:53,504
And then we'll go to the zip file

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,528
Unzip it

20
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
Have a look at it

21
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:58,112
And see those files

22
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:02,720
 extracted here

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,864
And inside of this we have an admin folder and inside admin ,a SQL folder

24
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,424
And here is the first file of interest

25
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,800
that's what Joomla uses to actually build a database upon the first install of the component

26
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,944
Do take note that it runs this file only on a fresh install of the component

27
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:27,040
Thereafter it will not run it again even if that's file gets updated

28
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Even if more values get added and usually it does JCB updates this file as you create new 

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
 views which in

30
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,048
Then it means a new table

31
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,400
And if you add Fields which means a new column or field in the database

32
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:44,448
And so

33
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:49,568
This file update but it is for those

34
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,968
Clients of yours that it couldn't install the component for the first time all those who already have the component installed

35
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,272
This file will mean nothing to them

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,088
All the files in this update folder

37
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
Is what would actually be relevant

38
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
If you have a client

39
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,464
Which has version

40
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:09,280
1.3.2 installed

41
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,816
on his system

42
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:14,400
Any gets this package from you this 2.0.0

43
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,424
Package

44
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
It will Actually

45
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:18,240
Start with

46
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
This file

47
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Then that one and so forth

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
It will start with a

49
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,920
File which is the same

50
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:30,784
Version as the version that is currently installed on

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,576
The Joomla website

52
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
So

53
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:35,392
That means

54
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000
JCB builds these files

55
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:42,048
In that expected way

56
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:43,584
Ok

57
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:48,960
Now let's go make a change to the component and see how JCB updates these files

58
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,848
Just gonna install the component

59
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,664
So we have it in the database

60
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,224
We can look at the database in the moment

61
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,784
To see how things change

62
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:06,368
Now I'm gonna open the admin views and I'm gonna add

63
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:08,160
A field

64
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
To the admin View called sermon

65
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,280
Is it gonna be any generic field

66
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
So that we can at least see it in action

67
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:22,752
I'm gonna call it mobile telephone

68
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,288
And

69
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,104
Just put in the fourth position

70
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,432
The left tab that's not really important but

71
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,968
Ok so there we go

72
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
We added a field

73
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:39,904
Now you could it disappoint also add a new view and JCB will detect both of them

74
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,464
And will add both of them to the update file

75
00:03:43,488 --> 00:03:44,000
But

76
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,792
You could even do that

77
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,584
You know

78
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:50,144
Make this change run the compiler

79
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,960
Have this new update

80
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:57,312
Then make another change ,run the compiler and it'll follow along

81
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
Incrementally

82
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
Incrementing the the version

83
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,688
Value of the component

84
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
As you go

85
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,272
Just for our sake

86
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,344
Maybe let me add a view

87
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,648
Already in another View

88
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,232
And then you'll see how JCB combines to these values

89
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:16,768
in one update

90
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:19,327
So I'm going to grab a

91
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:23,167
view that isn't already part of this component

92
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,471
And just for illustration

93
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
Save and close

94
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:31,615
There we go we gotta view and it a new field

95
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:34,431
If we compile the component now

96
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
It will

97
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:37,759
Do all those things that I've explained

98
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:44,415
There you see it's incremented into 2.0.1

99
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,975
And if we go to the zip file

100
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,303
again extracted open it up admin

101
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Sequel

102
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Updates

103
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:58,495
we now see there is actually a new file. Let's open this file just

104
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Investigate a little

105
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,823
So we see here's the

106
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,639
Command to actually add that new field

107
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:06,175
And here is another one

108
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
To create

109
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,735
That new table

110
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,295
And all of that is been placed into this

111
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,599
....

112
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
2.0.0

113
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:16,927
File

114
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
Which like I said is the current version

115
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,023
Of this installed

116
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,559
Component

117
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:25,375
If we look at the database at this point

118
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
You see there is no

119
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,703
Look table

120
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,775
And if we look at the Sermon table and structure

121
00:05:32,287 --> 00:05:34,591
Then we see that there is you know

122
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
No

123
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:37,919
Mobile field here

124
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:42,527
Ok so that's install it now and see the change

125
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:49,439
Ok it's been successful go back to the table

126
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,487
Let's just refresh this

127
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:54,815
I know you have it

128
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,607
Got field added

129
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,959
if we go back to the new table that it had to create

130
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
Scroll down

131
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,799
And there is the new table

132
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,127
So it's done both of those as expected

133
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,503
Secondly let me show you where it made some changes in JCB

134
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,551
To relation to this component

135
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:21,695
so you'll see that the component has automatically incremented it's version number

136
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:26,047
If we open this component updates area

137
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
You'll see that it has dynamically

138
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
Stored that same values that we saw on the file here next to the correct version

139
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
And it is actually created a new

140
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,639
Version entry

141
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,711
You have to manually update this URL

142
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,599
As there are too many variations here we couldn't actually implement this dynamically

143
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:54,719
 this URL is what is being used in your updates server file

144
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:59,071
If your component is set to have an update server file

145
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
And so

146
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,399
At this point

147
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:07,519
You can now continue even adding another view or even another field

148
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:13,919
and it'll just the same it'll increment it and it will update your database upon installation

149
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:17,247
And really that is as simple as it is

150
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,903
There are some places where that behaviour may not function as expected

151
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:30,047
The only one I'm very much aware of is the one that happens when you

152
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
Actually import

153
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:32,863
Or

154
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,215
Export a component from one JCB to another

155
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:42,847
Those of you that have used this you can export a component and then Import it Again

156
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:49,503
That effectively creates all the data in the relation to JCB but it does'nt

157
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,903
Recreate the history and the asset IDs and everything else which is related to its

158
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
Integration

159
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:59,231
Within the Joomla

160
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:02,047
Interface or Database

161
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,375
So that means for example your

162
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
There is no history

163
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,727
Regarding the admin views

164
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
And the only way to start any history for that View

165
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,847
Would be to open it

166
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
And to save and close it

167
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
That's the only way

168
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,831
Now that specific area will have a history track

169
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,159
Same goes with the admin views

170
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:30,719
You have to open them and save them

171
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
This one not the admin

172
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,607
 view itself but the actual Fields of the admin view

173
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,911
Open them save them again

174
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:44,543
This will create its first entry and serve as a reference point

175
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,871
To last time to the which those values were changed

176
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,223
If you compile the component at that point it will actually

177
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:55,551
Add two component ID to that specific entries

178
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:59,391
And use it as a reference point like I've said

179
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,535
Then having after having compiled it so you first saved them then compile the component

180
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,095
And then only start making your changes

181
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:11,423
So that you'll basically

182
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,031
Bring the component into the motion of What would be the natural

183
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Flow of development

184
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,895
This natural flow that you would

185
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:26,783
Create a component add views then add Fields to it all along saving closing saving

186
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:31,647
And that generates the history values that we actually need

187
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:33,183
To detect changes

00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:37,279
If you import a component none of those values exist and so

189
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,583
It won't behave as expected

190
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,727
Well that's just a heads up I supposed many of you might not even have this issue but

191
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
If you do

192
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,847
You will know at least where to look and what to do to fix it

193
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,151
Anyway that is a

194
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:56,735
Quick overview of JCB's

195
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,015
Implementation

196
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,623
To correspond to Joomla's conventions

197
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
In creating tables

198
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
And updating them

199
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,999
Dynamically

200
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,559
Through The SQL Files

201
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:12,351
In the updates folder

202
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:15,935
And yes I hope that

203
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:21,567
This is gonna be helpful to to those who may not have understood this before

204
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,639
Thanks for watching
