00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:01,536
Hi

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,144
I would like to show you how to set the site view permission

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,032
the Site view permission is really related to the front end of any site view

4
00:00:13,312 --> 00:00:17,152
Since it usually by Default set not allowed

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:19,968
And that is basically because

6
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,248
We have

7
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,808
The problem where

8
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
That data is controlled

9
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:27,904
By the

10
00:00:28,672 --> 00:00:30,976
Global settings of the component

11
00:00:31,232 --> 00:00:37,376
And unless you write some custom script to add that Global settings to the database for permission

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
It actually doesn't have those permissions set and because it's not set it's by Default always said to not allowed

13
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:47,872
Now let me explain that on a code level to you

14
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:52,480
Ok we will use sermon distributor which is

15
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
One of the demo components that is available

16
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,344
and if you are

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,440
Interested in buying access to this demo component

18
00:01:01,696 --> 00:01:03,744
It obviously has site views

19
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:04,768
So

20
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
If we open the options tab

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,592
You see there's a permissional or tab

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,176
And if we search for sight

23
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,760
You see there is category site access

24
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:29,088
Plural and category

25
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,976
Site Access singular there's also preacher site access and preachers

26
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,304
And series and series list

27
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840
And sermon

28
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:43,168
And all these various site accesses

29
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:46,496
Literally saying whether the public

30
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:49,824
Will have access Now by Default as I said

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
It is said to inherit

32
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,176
And inherit will actually say not allowed

33
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,064
Now they are there's something that I've done to try and accommodate this problem

34
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,856
In JCB

35
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,000
So Let's close out here and look at some of the code I have done there

36
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:11,584
so I will have to go to component Builder

37
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:13,888
And then to components

38
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:18,240
And I'll open sermon distributor

39
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,152
Then I will go to settings

40
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,992
And then sight views

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,528
I will click add

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
And

43
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
Now you will see that we have here

44
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,488
A value called default View

45
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,584
Now what the default view really is

46
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Is that the view

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
That

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,216
The component will

49
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,264
Direct you to

50
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,080
If you are accessing a view

51
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,152
That you as a user don't have access to

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,688
So

53
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:04,832
Usually we would set the default View to not have an access

54
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,880
Control

55
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
So

56
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,464
Will say ok the default View

57
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
Doesn't have access control

58
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:18,400
That means it's actually open and public to all

59
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,984
And then we could

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:24,544
Explain on this view

61
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,128
How to get access for example to the rest of the component

62
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:30,688
.

63
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:37,088
For because you could see in what user group the user is and you can by that determines some messages

64
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,392
Ok

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
So that means whenever you have obviously there can only be one default view even if you select more than

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
One the first one the compiler gets to will become the default view the next one will be ignored 

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
So they can only be one at the moment it says that here select the only one and so if you have an 

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,176
Access for categories and it's not yet set

69
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,528
It will throw the user back to for example here preachers

70
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,808
Now

71
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:13,184
What is the advantage of this it Simply negates the error page

72
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:16,512
So did you don't get a loop where the

73
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,911
The permission just never gets resolved so just goes into a loop and then crash the site

74
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:29,311
This prevents that but it obviously doesn't solve our permission structure of completely

75
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
But it is at least a first step towards trying to resolve it so you would say it

76
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:43,391
This is your default page don't give the default page permissional structure so if any of the other pages is Accessed

77
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:46,207
 it will divert to the default page

78
00:04:48,511 --> 00:04:53,631
And now the next step that we have to try and address this problem

79
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,959
Is some custom scripting

80
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,007
That you can add

81
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,311
Which will show

82
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:05,407
After installation so let me show you some of that

83
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:10,783
The component where we actually have this shown is the demo component

84
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,599
So you can just open the PHP tab

85
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,927
And in the PHP tab you see

86
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:19,487
That it has a enqueue message

87
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:25,887
In the post flight in stalled blocks basically gets the factory

88
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:32,287
Get application first set the component Global setting and the permissions in the option

89
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Area

90
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:37,407
or the front end of the component will not work as expected

91
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:42,015
Please note that each view on the front end has access and permissions

92
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:45,343
So if you would like the public to access those views

93
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:47,903
They must be given the access and

94
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
Permission

95
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
And then this is just an info

96
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:53,279
Message that comes up

97
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,095
Basically after install

98
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
So that is another way that we've tried to help the user realise that he needs to

99
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:05,567
Add some now you can obviously

100
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,359
Change this into a link

101
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,407
Become very fancy

102
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,431
Or

103
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,455
You could

104
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,735
Even add

105
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,527
Custom script here

106
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:16,063
That updates

107
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,087
The

108
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,463
This components promotional structure

109
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:28,607
And actually adds the public to to have access to the site views

110
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
These are some of the ways that we are trying to resolve the permissional restraints

111
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:36,287
Of Site views

112
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:38,079
Now

113
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:44,991
let's look at this, I was saying earlier at the code level so forgive me for taking so long to get

114
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,719
So here we have the access file open of sermon distributor

115
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:58,303
And if we do a search here

116
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Site

117
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:04,703
You see that it has the site access values set for the component

118
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
Now

119
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
When we look at

120
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,079
The front end of the component

121
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
Open categories

122
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:17,247
You see that here it is asking whether the user

123
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,551
Has that access

124
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
And then if it doesn't

125
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:27,231
It does a redirect and then redirects to the default page you see that

126
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:30,559
Now let's open the default page

127
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,119
And

128
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
The ideal of the default page

129
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,287
Is that if the default page is not the site route

130
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:46,431
It will If It cannot access the default page it will actually add this error

131
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:50,015
And then redirect to the site root

132
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:53,343
Which being the websites homepage

133
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:57,439
And so that's kind of how we trying to

134
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Prevent the

135
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,839
This permissional structure from interfering with your user experience

136
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,679
Now if we go back to the component

137
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:12,799
The Sermon Distributer component

138
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,639
And we again open the site views

139
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:21,503
This time I change it that is doesn't have access

140
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,551
I actually save it that way

141
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Go to the compiler

142
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
Compile Sermon distributor

143
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
and install

144
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:48,127
Ok now let's go back to the code

145
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
Now you'll see

146
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:57,343
That it doesn't have any of that checks in the preachers file

147
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
Only in the category

148
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,159
File

149
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
And it still redirects to preachers

150
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:07,583
Which in effect means that this one will no longer give any errors

151
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:11,423
But it will show these errors

152
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,007
Which relates to the fact that they cannot see

153
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,311
The the categories

154
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:23,199
Now I think some of the advancements that we might still think on doing is maybe

155
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:27,295
Add a field to the component

156
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,879
Where the user can change these errors

157
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159
To show

158
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,487
Maybe a message of how to purchase access or something

159
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:41,887
Yeah we could still look at that you do realise that this stage

160
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:47,775
JCB does have the the option to actually customise any section of code

161
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:52,895
So by using what is known as the custom code implementation

162
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:58,527
Now I'm not gonna demonstrate that please go look and review those videos they are on YouTube

163
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,575
Where you can literally

164
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Change this whole code block here

165
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,183
And then

166
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,791
Use use your own implementation upon these measures

167
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:16,191
Well that is a a quick demonstration or explanation on how to manage

168
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
The different

169
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:25,151
permissional structures for JCB regarding the site front-end

170
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:29,503
So if you do not want that

171
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:33,343
Control you can simply obviously just put it off

172
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,695
But I realize that most of you

173
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:44,095
Might want to add some custom scripting that adds permissions to the database for that component

174
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,471
That's little bit Beyond the scope of where JCB is at the moment

175
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:54,335
Aldo that is a nice to have there are more pressing things that we'll focus on

176
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
First
