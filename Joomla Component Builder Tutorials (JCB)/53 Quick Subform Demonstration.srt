00:00:00,512 --> 00:00:03,328
I recently had this

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:05,376
Request on the Forum

3
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:07,680
By Marco

4
00:00:08,192 --> 00:00:11,008
Regarding some help with Sub forms

5
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:16,384
How to generate a subform itself writing in JCB

6
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:22,528
Where to find the XML details in relation to repeated subform fields in View

7
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,112
How the data of the subform is populated

8
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:31,488
How posted data of a subform is validated

9
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,072
How data of a subform is processed and

10
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:36,096
Persisted

11
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:43,776
My assumption is it above is done as part of JCB and would not require manual construction

12
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:45,312
Of XML files

13
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:49,152
 Googled but found an answer to no avail

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,456
Yes

15
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992
At the moment

16
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:55,552
We have

17
00:00:55,808 --> 00:00:58,624
Only made tutorials about

18
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,440
I think repeatable fields

19
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:05,024
And repeatable Fields as such has been discontinued

20
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,632
I don't think I've actually made a tutorial about subforms as yet

21
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,448
So here it goes let's do it

22
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:15,264
Ok first thing First

23
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:20,896
Subforums have fields in them that much we know right

24
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:27,296
So if we gonna go to component for example let's say we open this admin view

25
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,880
We are actually looking at a subform right this is a subform

26
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:33,696
And each of these little

27
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:37,792
Fields here is a field in the subform

28
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:44,192
And actually is only an ID which you need to add to create

29
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,568
 the subform so what do you do if your first create what this is a 

30
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
Custom field

31
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:56,736
That basically grabs values out of the admin view so this is a custom field this one

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:02:00,064
You create that one this is a list field

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,720
You create list field this is a checkbox so you basically create these Fields First

34
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,584
That's the first thing you do you create a field you wanna use in the subform

35
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,936
So for our purposes I'm gonna use existing fields

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:18,240
I just to sort of demonstrate

37
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,896
Ok so we've got what we have the description mobile number name we got a few Fields here

38
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:26,944
Ok so

39
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
First we wanna create a new field

40
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,296
So I'm gonna

41
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,600
First create

42
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,184
Open that we have both open so I can get the IDs

43
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,000
So then here click new

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,376
And basically select subform right

45
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:47,168
Subform there we go

46
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,520
and it actually populates your XML for you

47
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
Now something tells me

48
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:54,592
That

49
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,552
If you haven't actually looked at all the tutorials

50
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,856
That is available on Google

51
00:03:06,368 --> 00:03:07,392
Sorry on YouTube

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
Then a lot of this world maybe you not even make sense of what I'm doing where I'm doing it and all that and

53
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:14,816
So

54
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:21,216
For those that maybe just seeing this video and not watched any of the other tutorials

55
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,312
Please go to YouTube and type in Joomla component Builder

56
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:29,920
And try to find the playlist there's old playlist full of tutorials

57
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
Start at the top working through way down it so many tutorials many hours that I have spent trying to 

58
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,088
Teach

59
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
And guide people in using this component and I know those tutorials will make you

60
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,048
You quite able to build amazing things

61
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:50,656
Ok so I'm gonna just leave this options the option list

62
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:57,312
This form source if you read here you can add a path to an XML file containing the field

63
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,896
So you can add a custom

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:07,296
A XML file to your component how to add custom files to component hold not a topic it's

65
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:13,696
It's also possible within your Joomla component to add files and folders all those kind of things

66
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:19,071
But that means this specific source can still be used but you don't need to

67
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,095
If you

68
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
Use the fields

69
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,567
Option then you basically need to remove the source option right only one of them so only the fields

70
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,383
or the field form source

71
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,991
So these are the two options I see it's currently set to mandatory the fields

72
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:38,783
But

73
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
I think you can change that

74
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,903
Going to the field types change that to optional

75
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,047
And then that you can select other Fields or field source form source

76
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:56,447
I think the compiler will in any case if it detects there is a form source it will behave correctly

77
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:02,591
 here we need to add the IDs so we can come here and I want to have a name

78
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,639
So it's just 199

79
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:08,991
I just add 199 and a comma

80
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,831
And then let's add something else let's say

81
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
Website

82
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,903
280

83
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:19,231
So it's 280

84
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,303
And let's do an email as well

85
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,119
Where is it

86
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
There's no email here oh there's an email

87
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:31,007
And it's 100

88
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,055
Ok so we have

89
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,639
That in place we can add a description

90
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,711
We can add a maximum

91
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
A filter, a show on, I'm just gonna leave this the validation of these fields

92
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:48,671
I think

93
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:52,255
That is an area which I haven't actually looked into

94
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,303
But if I'm correct

95
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:58,399
And also the reason why they moved away from repeatable fields

96
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
Is that every field is validated

97
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,775
On its own merit

98
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,311
So for example

99
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
The name field

100
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
If you create a name field you're obviously

101
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:15,039
Saying ok I want this to be a string and it has this filter string

102
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,063
Value

103
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,671
And since this is part of the XML it will be validated on this

104
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:24,255
I can be mistaken here

105
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:30,655
And yeah I haven't actually looked at the code so mind that but that's

106
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:35,519
That's what I anticipate it will do most cases I would say

107
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:41,663
Anticipate that it doesn't and try and do some custom scripting

108
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:44,223
I'm not gonna illustrate that now

109
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,759
Are you need to

110
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:51,135
Actually know little bit more about JCB which there are tons of the tutorials to show you

111
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:57,535
How to do custom scripting all around it component and even to do custom scripting anywhere and

112
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:02,655
Any area of the component through the custom code area implementation

113
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,495
So I'm gonna talk more about that now

114
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,519
So

115
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,311
For now we want to

116
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,847
Just

117
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,431
Make sure it got all the spelling right here

118
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,711
Ok good

119
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:18,271
I'm gonna save this just give it a name

120
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:22,111
Options and test so I can see it

121
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
This obviously I would make

122
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,951
A text

123
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:30,047
The default means that JCB already

124
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:31,839
the Store method

125
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,631
.......

126
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,191
it will detect that this is a 

127
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Subform

128
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,519
And will add the needed

129
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:44,895
PHP in storing the file and in loading the file into the form again

130
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,943
So that takes care of that

131
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:50,783
So you don't need to actually say Json it will

132
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:57,183
On its own by its default to the correct implementation here so you need to make sure either to click

133
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:02,303
Text or medium text depending on what this value is gonna be

134
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:06,143
Anyway I think for 50 text is quite enough

135
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,447
And that's it saving close

136
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,359
Ok

137
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
Sorry about that

138
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,919
it will span there

139
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:25,599
Let's see we got that field here it is I'm gonna just add it to any view for now

140
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,415
Let's see I'm gonna add it to this look View

141
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:30,719
Just so we can see it in action

142
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,791
now the look view is part of the demo component

143
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,119
So I'm just gonna dump it in here let's see

144
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,679
Above tab full width details

145
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:42,751
 description I think let's just add it there

146
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
Details also full width

147
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,847
make it the 2nd

148
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,639
And I say

149
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:50,687
Options

150
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,247
And then we got a test right

151
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,343
Ok save and close so we've added it to a view

152
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,207
Now I'm just gonna compile this component which the view belongs to

153
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:04,511
Which at this stage it is demo

154
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
 and install it

155
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
Now let's go open that component

156
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
And let's open a look

157
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:24,735
And here we go name enter name here enter website address enter email

158
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
We click there

159
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,343
And our values are there

160
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,159
Let's just save one Hi

161
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:35,231
Children

162
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,815
We can do I think that's the only one that's

163
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,607
Oh yes you do have

164
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:45,983
Let's do that and why enter those values and then some

165
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,775
Value

166
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Sorry

167
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,919
And I'm just gonna grab this

168
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,943
up here

169
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:57,503
paste it in there few times

170
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,343
Just gonna put here

171
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:06,207
Joomla@ VDM.io

172
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,791
Put that in here

173
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
To get sort of a feel for it

174
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:33,087
Ok save

175
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:39,999
Ok it's safe to values it loaded it back it's done all of that Hi 

176
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:41,279
There

177
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,327
then save and close

178
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:44,863
and so

179
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,655
If we open it again

180
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
It shows it up again

181
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
And now we can shuffle it

182
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,311
Let me just put

183
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Number for a Top

184
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,639
Save it close

185
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,455
And open again

186
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,319
And so it is loading it also correctly

187
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:07,647
Ok well that's a quick demonstration

188
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:09,439
Marco I hope this helps

189
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,767
And getting you able to use subforms

190
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,559
With JCB

191
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,607
It's as easy as that

192
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Thanks for watching
