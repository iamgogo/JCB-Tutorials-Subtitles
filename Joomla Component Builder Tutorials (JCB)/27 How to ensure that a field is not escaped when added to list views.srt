Hi

2
00:00:01,792 --> 00:00:06,400
Sometimes one would like to add extra styling like this

3
00:00:06,912 --> 00:00:08,192
Or like that

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,240
To a listview

5
00:00:11,264 --> 00:00:13,568
The problem though is that by Default

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,200
All of the fields all of these field values are being escaped

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:20,992
And so

8
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,832
If you would like to add let's say this this kind of styling

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,136
to a field view

10
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:28,672
Let me show you how I did it

11
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,304
In the job order admin View area

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:37,888
If you go to PHP

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,824
There is a method called add PHP getitems method before translation fix and decryption

14
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:48,896
So this happens before

15
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:52,480
The translation or The Fixer or the decryption

16
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:55,808
Sorry the translation fix or the decryption of any field

17
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,000
This is not the ideal place you usually would add it after that was done but in this case I did it before

18
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,584
So basically I am setting up

19
00:01:08,096 --> 00:01:09,120
A value

20
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,960
That when I wanna use danger when I wanna use warning

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Simply using

22
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:15,520
The

23
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:18,336
The getDate and modifying it

24
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:23,200
By the danger time and the warning time from the

25
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:24,480
Job tracking

26
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:32,928
Configuration values so this is a configuration field that I've added to the component and it

27
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:36,000
It's names are warning time and danger time

28
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:39,328
And the default is 3 weeks 1 week

29
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,144
And basically this is the date

30
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,448
The dates that I would then use

31
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,008
I then look through the data

32
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,568
And when I identify

33
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,384
data that is actually

34
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,688
Part of the target

35
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
I add

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,320
This

37
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:01,856
Value to it

38
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:07,488
That then intern turns this red

39
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:09,280
Ok

40
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,096
And then the next one

41
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,632
Is I check the dates

42
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,264
And then depending on its values I again add some HTML value

43
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:22,592
To the the date and I use a custom

44
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,664
A method in a helper class call fancyDate

45
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,712
Where I convert the

46
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:28,736
Default

47
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,784
Sequel date

48
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
to a better date or a better looking date

49
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,136
2nd of April or something

50
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
Ok

51
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,440
So

52
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,976
The problem is though

53
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:40,512
If you do this

54
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,816
And you

55
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:49,472
Compile your component add items go look at it you'd see that it actually escapes those values and it prints it

56
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Out

57
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,520
Like a

58
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:53,824
You know like you see it over here

59
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,872
It actually prints out

60
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
That

61
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,920
Around

62
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,944
The value

63
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:03,040
And that's obviously not what you'd like and the reason why it does that

64
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:05,856
Because all values are being escaped

65
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,952
Now there is a way to to stop that from being

66
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:10,976
from happening

67
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,328
And that that is really what this tutorial is about

68
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,144
To show you how to prevent

69
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,192
That escaping

70
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:25,056
So the value we have here is to create date

71
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:27,360
As well as the job status

72
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,200
So I'm gonna go in I'm still in the

73
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,272
The back end of the component

74
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,808
Job order

75
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,368
And I'm going to go to the fields

76
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,464
And then I'm gonna scroll down to that that value

77
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:51,680
Let 's see where is it now Job status

78
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,472
Ok I'm gonna open it

79
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,544
And if I then

80
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:00,896
Having a it open and I can scroll down and even here

81
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,944
You see that there

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:09,344
It doesn't show up here sorry I should actually had it but the reality is 

83
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,672
way at the bottom you see I added this little line

84
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,208
I set escape

85
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,744
Equals

86
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,791
False

87
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:22,399
So you would simply add this line

88
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:26,495
And then when component Builder compiles

89
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,311
It will actually in the body

90
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
Of the component where that field is loaded

91
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:34,175
It will tell the

92
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:36,735
Escape method not to escape it

93
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,039
So that it would then

94
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:42,623
Display the html instead of printing it out

95
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:46,975
So that is really what it's all about maybe it's

96
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:50,047
Got a lot of explanation for such a simple thing

97
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,167
But I can tell you what if you can't do that it's quite frustrating because

98
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:59,263
Sometimes you would like to give some indication with some HTML

99
00:05:00,031 --> 00:05:02,079
upon the value and then this

100
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,663
Feature actually allows that like you could see here

101
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,247
We were able to add a nice button around these dates

102
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
And as well as adding some colour to to these words here and yeah

103
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:22,047
So that is a quick demonstration of how to make use of the not escape

104
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:24,863
Method or concept

105
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:28,959
When it comes to list views around the field values

106
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:30,751
Hope that makes sense

107
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:36,383
You have any questions please don't hesitate to let me know

108
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
And

109
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,223
Until next time take care thanks for watching
